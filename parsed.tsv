I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking at and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement for a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.	I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip.

First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others.

In the next few years  people's homes will be changing a lot. The first point is we will use more often new technologies like telecommunications or the Internet. In the future . That means for example, while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer. You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off. Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or cheese. Or, without leaving the office, you are able to heat the water for a hot bath. So in fact people's homes will become more convenient and more comfortable. I think also housewives will receive more help with a robot in the home. But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same. And of course the furniture of people's homes will not change either.	In the next few years the people's home will be changes a lot.

My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert. A man came out from a small building. It was our pilot. He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane. The doors of the plane were so thin that I thought I could have torn them. We went inside and the plane took off. It was horrible. I could feel every movement which was caused by  or wind. I thought we would die.	My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert.

Three years ago, when I was in Japan, my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I get back from the school. I always had my own key and unlock the door by myself.
It was a horrible day, the day I left my key at home! There was nobody to let me in, no way to contact  my parents. What I decided to do was to get into the house by climbing on the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked. First, I climbed the tree in the garden. It was okay, because I was quite good at that, but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof! It had been raining, the previous day, so the roof was slippery! I managed to do that although I cut my knee! I walked on the roof carefully, so as not to slip. I was extremely happy when I got into the house. It was a scary, but thrilling and exciting incident!

The path we were walking on was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There was neither a bridge nor a canoe.

However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m. All of us would like to go to the show.

In my opinion, each human being has a right to be free. We can go for a walk, go shopping, go to the cinema, get married or divorced. Why can't famous people do all these things? Why must everybody know and talk about their private life? The most important thing is that  famous people are also normal people like us. They live like us, they breathe and eat like us, they even fall in love like us. I think they should have a normal private life without journalists following them all the time and without any  details about them appearing in the different newspapers' .

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to covering celebrities. Taking everything into account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits.

But on the other hand, the aim of a ""public job"" such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the : Do we have to  someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question..."

We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are very happy and satisfied with their life. But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.

We can consider this problem from two different points of view. On the one hand, these people chose to become public figures. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't go into politics or the movies! But, on the other hand, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of  Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach  extremes.	We can watch this problem from two different points of view. From one side, this people chose to become public people.

"Thanks a lot for your letter. I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams. Therefore I read Agatha Christie's ""Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". I can really recommend this book to you. It is fabulous. It is also a suitable present for your cousin, I think. One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island. There is a storm and they cannot leave. Suddenly a murder takes place! Believe me, you would never guess who the killer is! There is also Hercule Poirot, the famous detective, and he finally solves the mystery. But I will not tell you any more. You have to read it yourself.

Well, I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will respond to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers which will control everything, every item of furniture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programme them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they will just stay in their rooms and study on a computer, gaining some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, cups will be washed automatically. It is possible that only one computer will do all this and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight..

First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own life private, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce or a family member's or  closest friend's death. It is too cruel for them to have their feeling monitored at that time.

It is too cruel for them to be monitored their feelings at that time.
Another reason that I agree that famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was the ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparazzi when she was dating  a man, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.

To sum up, nobody wants their private life to be revealed in public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.	To sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.

However, could we make a suggestion?

How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city, so famous for that!

On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for  media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more famous they will be. In my opinion, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I think that some stars sometimes call journalists to tell them where they will be, in order to have free publicity. Moreover, in my opinion, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interviews, either in the newspapers or on television, that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it.	On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television.
On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they are under to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photographer. They cannot go to public places, unless they disguise themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because of their temper or out of regard for their children. Nevertheless, they are never left alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, which we often forget they are. 	On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame.

In my opinion, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will have a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights in the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa.

Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like a UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very great, they will probably consist of making the housework easier. The clearest example is to compare a house from the beginning of the 20th century with our houses. Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. On balance then, I think that the houses that we  see in films won't really exist.

"Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences of fame, like not having a ""private life"" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters . I can imagine how annoying it can be sometimes. Just imagine that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends.

"Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling ; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. The press takes this demand as an order, and ""but the public wants to know"" becomes a nightmare for famous people."

In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend so much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy. I am quite sure that even the ones who have chosen their occupations just to be famous, don't like to be photographed when they believe they are alone. The situation must be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring it.	In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998, but it wasn't 13th even it look like it, but it was my 25th birthday.

Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in a dangerous and  way and I don't know how, but he was able to persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, on my 25th birthday. I was at home putting my makeup on before going to a restaurant with my friends and, suddenly, he rang the bell. He was so tense with a gun in his hands and I could no longer speak.

In my opinion, you don't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when you start your career you know that the media will be hunting you everywhere and the more famous you get the worse it is going to be because that is the lifestyle people want to know everything about, for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president. They saw them many times on T.V. or in the cinema. So people wonder about them. And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever, it's because you like to show yourself.

And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever it's because you like to show yourself.
Therefore, even if I agree sometimes the media go too far and write really bad things, if you're famous you cannot have a private life because all of this is a part of your job.	therefore, even if I agree sometimes   are going too far and write really bad things. if you're famous you cannot have  private life because all of this is a part of their job.

I'm suggesting how the programme could be changed. The fashion show starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be held on 14 March, so we can change the shopping with this event, which is held in the afternoon, and do the shopping at night.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I climbed up the tree. My friend was looking at me from below. I went on climbing until I saw my friend's model aeroplane. If I hadn't borrowed it from him, I wouldn't have been there. No, it wasn't the time to regret it, just get it and it would be all over. I stretched my arm, the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg. It was badly hurt. My friend rushed to me, then ran back to my house and called Mum. I can't remember anything else until I woke up at a hospital, lying on a bed with my leg in plaster. The nurse sitting beside me said to me, 'Your mother would like to have a word with you,' then she went out. Mum came in, looking very angry. I prayed for a short conversation.

It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV, and go to shows and sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things cannot give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world that will buy that.

However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and  all wish to attend. It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March. It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm. The show will be about all the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students.	However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend.

I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in . We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can, however, go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show.	I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .

Every day, something changes and we become more modern. Companies use computers instead of books, dentists use modernized electric tools instead of just a pair of pliers. Even homes are affected. From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves. But we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and those things now new to us will be old, outdated and changed.

No, in the future, the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old, outdated and changed.
I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We can turn on and off lights with touch pads and remote controls. We might even be able to open the door without leaving  the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door.	I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised.

Although all that may happen our houses may be still the same. The rooms and sizes should remain as they were and the living rooms and everything may still be decorated in the same style.

In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and discs. They will never have to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something else with the same purpose.	In the future, every child might have a laptop.

Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.

This is why gossip magazines are so popular. , journalists have to follow them all the time to peep into their private lives to satisfy us. Therefore, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them.	Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.

You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of the English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for them. Why? Because he  concentrates on the history, society and political situation of the time the story is set. That can be quite difficult to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She writes books especially for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him!

May I suggest an alternative plan? We could go to the science museum on Wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery too. We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning, but that would allow us to go to the show on Tuesday, because we can use  Wednesday's free time to do our shopping. I hope that my idea is acceptable to you and you'll agree.	May I suggest an alternative ? We could go to  science museum on wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery .

I understand that you're looking for a birthday present for your cousin, and you'd like to give  her a book, which, I think, is a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a fantastic book, which I recommend to everybody keen on love stories. It's a perfect combination of passion and life's difficulties. I reckon that it's  not an easy read, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's so good at literature that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personality. It'll be a good point for her general education. Wuthering Heights is a classic, which everybody knows about , even if they haven't read it, they at least know the story.

That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well. I checked everything again and again. I was afraid  to do it but I had to do it. It was the first time I had robbed a bank. I was her best friend. I promised her I would find the money for her operation. She was at the hospital and she was really bad.	That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well.

She was at the hospital and she was really bad.
At that time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change. After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on. I didn't want anybody to recognise me. Despite feeling really bad I left home. I got into my car and started it. When I arrived at the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank. I told everybody to lie down. They did it. I asked the cashier to give me all the money. Before I took the money one of the cashiers had pressed a button to call the police. I quickly left the bank.	That time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change.

"Some people have said that famous people such as politicians, and film stars, need to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. I strongly agree with this. Firstly, most people can remember the sad story of ""Princess Diana"". She died in Paris a few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called ""Paparazzi"". If she had not been followed by journalists, she wouldn't have died. So, this fact shows obviously that famous people without a private life can become  victims."

"However, secondly, famous people are not ""alien"" so  they might do something, for example, shameful things in a public space, or argue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us.

Overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.

I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going  shopping, so I believe it will be a good chance for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is compatible as well with our programme because by 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.

Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly about what  it includes. The latest fashions will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting!

I believe that if somebody wants  fame and  glory he must be totally clear about the results.

If somebody wants to be famous of course they must be  and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that there are limits. Everybody deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of career or job you have. You must control your behaviour and try not  so much yourself. And finally the journalists  should know how to respect the private lives of everyone and not try to make money  by using the reputation of  famous people.

Maybe, in a few years' time we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, in my opinion, I think these facts will not change our way of  life.

Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days' stay in London.  It contains a wide range of activities, for example, sightseeing, a river trip, visiting the science museum and gallery, shopping.  It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment. However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.  The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to attend for free.

All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls, are interested in fashion and make-up, so we are expecting the show to be a great opportunity to see what the new trends in fashion will be like. It would be great if you made a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show.

"Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food.  Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their lives have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off.  Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work. In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a ""family"".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. A computer might know more than a human, but there are many things which it cannot replace in our life."

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having a holiday with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited by some locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy about having such a special opportunity of visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.	It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.

Whenever they go out they are suddenly ""hounded"" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo. They cannot even have a pizza with  stops them and asks them for an autograph.

It is from 10 am to 7 p.m. It  the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. All of us are really interested, and it is free for students to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things  there. So would you please reschedule the visit to the Science Museum for Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday.

It was two years ago. My classmates and I went on a leadership trip to London. This trip was organised by our form tutor.

The first days was going fine, we just had to do some teamwork things.
On the second day, we had to climb up a twenty-metre hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I had been really scared to stand on a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and carefully, and I climbed about 15 metres quite successfully, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right foot slipped . I  nearly fell , but luckily my hand caught a rock. It was dangerous, but I didn't have any choice. Finally I did it.

"I think that if famous people are always followed by journalists it is not the fault of the media but of the huge number of people who are interested in famous people's lives. Firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers. Secondly, it is because they have a lot of admiration for them and lastly because they want to dream and see what a ""star's life"" looks like."

On the other hand, our class has recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th.

A few students and I have heard about a fashion and leisure show. The show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00.

One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without being seen and started walking towards the river, because I wanted to take some photographs of the sunrise. The view was taking my breath away when suddenly something took my breath away. It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as if it was very hungry.

Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for the English class, especially since it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in the English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement for in this week's college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting  London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sportswear, make-up and hairstyles. As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as advice about dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should be a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most  students in our class are studying Fashion  full-time. Especially, it does not cost anything at all for students. But the only problem with the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go to the Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these places the  following day. But Mr. Robertson, these  suggestions depend on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we are causing you  inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us.

Our homes will be different in order to protect our family from theives. For example, now we have a security  like a bell or button. But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside. That means, our security system will be much stronger. On the other hand, what might still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace. Because it is an instinct that people prefer comfortable places and want to take a rest in a peaceful place.	Our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives.

We had decided to climb that more than 3,700-metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on the 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediately see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobile phone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped!

I finally decided to carry him on my back  back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stayed where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from where we were able to call a helicopter. We were safe!	I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time.

As you are probably aware  our English class is going to spend three days in London. The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have drawn up a very nice schedule for us. The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but because of the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class have asked me to suggest a change in our schedule.

The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but due to the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class asked me to propose a change in our schedule.
This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases in sportswear, make up and hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would have fun, meet the locals and practise our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school.

Best Detective Stories by Agatha Christie	Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie
I'm sorry it took me so long to write back to you, but I have been very busy lately. Anyway, in your last letter you asked me whether Best Detective Stories by Agatha Christie would be a good present or not for your cousin.

Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie would be or not a good present for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea!
You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones in which you keep trying to figure  out who is the killer. Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin. Especially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them. Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published.

Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holiday? My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go to college. My parents and I will spend our holidays in Australia and I just couldn't be happier! I just can't wait to go abroad for the first time!	Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holidays.

I believe all  people, famous or not, deserve to have a private life without journalists  following them all the time. They are humans like all of us, with their problems, their good and bad times, and of course they don't want  to publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this would be right, and good for his pocket.

It was a fantastic sunny day in August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided  to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We lay on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volleyball matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons  and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing at me. So I took the decision to go and join them as well though I knew that it would be dangerous . I waded very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends would realize that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided to take up swimming, so that I would have no embarrassments on  future trips to the seaside .

When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily nobody was. Then I approached the door slowly, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet.

Suddenly something went wrong. The alarm was making a noise. I ran towards the diamond, grabbed it, got out quickly, and ran out of the back door. By chance I saw a car waiting for me outside.

Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in Portugal. Everything was new for me. I had to  tidy up the place where they have to wait for their turn.

In answer to your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my hobby and I sleep in tents every time I go camping. Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily. Besides camping, I also like painting. My Dad is an amateur painter, and I have been painting for 8 years. I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before. Will I get any tuition?

Everyone likes sales, but those so-called sale items are not really good value. In the fashion industry, sales begin at the end of each season and just last a short time, because those retailers want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon gets out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have invested a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under the influence of these tricks. The result is we feel guilty after spending more than we expected, or even suffer from financial difficulty.

Shopping does not just affect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping.

But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they?	Shopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping.

Shopping is an ordinary . We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruit, milk  etc.  most people will do their shopping twice a week for  fresh food. You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it is always enjoyable. You have to try to park your car first, and sometimes the car parks are full and after you have parked your car and got into the supermarket the product you wanted has run out so you have to change your plan for dinner or go to another supermarket to face a long queue. That makes  which was not fun at all.	Shopping is an ordinary . We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruits, milk and etc.  most people will do their shopping twice a week for a fresh food.

Women love shopping. I am a woman so I love it a lot. Every weekend I and my boyfriend go to the B.H Shopping Center. I live in Site Belo and he lives near the B.H. Shopping Center.

We are different. We need different things to men. Yesterday he called me and told me that he loves me, anyway. I believe him because he is a great man. I hope that he forgets about my shopping.

When the concert finished my favourite singer talked to me &amp; they invited me to play the piano in their next concert and they said that because I performed well in that concert.

I would prefer to stay in a cabin because I have not really had good experiences of camping in tents. Last time a bear came inside while I was in the tent.

I would like to play tennis and go surfing. I must say I am quite good at tennis. I started playing very young, and I've never stopped playing it since then. I couldn't say the same about surfing though. I've done it only twice in my entire life but I really enjoyed doing it.	I would like to play tennis and  surfing. I must say I am quite good at tennis.

Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing well, I am and so is my family and everything around here. You are not going to believe what happened last month!!! I helped Korn at a concert they had at the Auditorium. I met this guy at a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert. Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they wanted. The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them. We even had our pictures taken with them and they gave us their autographs. It was so much fun, we had a great time that night. Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all. Please write back. Love, Lolita.	Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been?

In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable. Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in the shopping centre that you can't move  forwards or backwards. Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours only to pay for a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket. I think you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something.	In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable.

And then, I had to help the singer to put on some make-up. I was very frightened I might put too much make-up on their faces, but everything was all right. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for the staff or the singers.

I would like to answer your questions about this trip. First of all, I'm living in Leeds and also studying English at a college. Therefore, I need to wait until my college's lessons have finished. If  possible  I would prefer to come in July. Before now, I have usually stayed in log cabins, but I have never had the chance  to stay in a tent. In my opinion, staying in  tents is more exciting than staying in  log cabins. That's why I would love to live in a tent for 2 weeks!	I would like to answer your questions about this trip.

I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of staff. He asked  me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt like the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it.	I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff.

But the most amazing thing happened later, when, ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from backstage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The music was excellent, the audience enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there,  ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer on a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always treasure it.

About the activities listed in your letter, I choose basketball and singing. I have played basketball for six years, and I've been in competitions for five years. I have good singing skills too.

I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you like, in which I also play the guitar.	About the activities listed on your letter, I choose basketball and singing.

Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot be comfortable because of the crowds. Why it's always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundred other people. We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure. I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods.	Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot go confortable because of  crowd.

For me going shopping is not the best thing I can do. Well I thought the opposite about a year ago but recently I have thought this because I see all the people going shopping and they don't realise that  outside in the real world there are poor people who need that money which they are only spending on material things. You might put your money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and I don't like spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. As to the rest of you who don't understand this, it's on your mind to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need.

I think I told you about my plans  to join a group that helps at concerts, didn't I? Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert. Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium. There were about 100 000 people. We had a lot of things to do. Actually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific.

Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free from my job. It will be impossible at another time, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think it is the best month to travel; the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons.

Secondly, my choice is the accommodation in tents. I think it could be more interesting. I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside. In my opinion if I choose the log cabin it will be like being at home.

About the two activities I need to select, I think the best ones are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it. I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago. I felt really healthy. My other choice is painting. I have been painting since I was ten years old. I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class.

One thing I would like to ask is if I need special clothes. I don't know what kind of camp I am going to. It should be a dry place, I think, but I would like to make sure . Also, I would like to know how much money I will need, because  I don't know if there will be any gift shops.

"The most popular ""sport"" that everyone does is obviously shopping.

"The most popular ""sport"" that all the people do it's obiously shopping.

Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewellery, furniture, etc. and you could have a really great time.	Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, , furnitures, etc. and you could have a real great time.
But other people don't think like this. For example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost. The mother was shocked. She didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out . It was a nightmare but fortunately the police found her.

Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagine being in Japan or China and having to go to the shops? I don't think that I'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. And also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. I mean that some people can fight to get something. Where are we going!!	Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen be in Japan or China and have to go to the shops?

In my opinion shopping is not a thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful, there are too many people in the shops, so I prefer to spend my free time  swimming or painting and I go shopping on the days when usually there are not too many people.

The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really more interesting than I expected. My job  behind the stage was helping with make-up, hair and clothes . It was very hard. The singers often changed their clothes and their make-up was  because of the sweat. It was different from when I did it at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous singers and spoke to them. So many people were in front of the stage and they couldn't see them very well, but I was  very near to the stage and I could see them just there.

A survey has been done, and the issue is which subjects (lessons) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable. Someone says it is maths -  practical, useful  -  but the majority say it is boring, unless you're choosing a job which demands all your maths knowledge such as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer. The majority have chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, ages. People must get some rest often, and as a result they look forward to some happiness  free time  .  That should be filmed.	A survey has been done, and the issue is, wich subjects (lessons) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables.

You are asking me to choose just 2 activities.

I'm rather experienced at climbing. I have done it once a month since I was 17. But on the other hand, I have never been surfing. I am a complete beginner but I am dying to do it.

Anyway, to participate in two-weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information. First of all, the most favourable time for me to travel is July, because I am in the final year of University, so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July, when I can take a relatively long summer holiday. Secondly, I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents, since I have had a horrible experience being attacked by a swarm of midges, when I camped out. Additionally, I am very happy to be given the chance to do some activities during the stay. I would  like to choose swimming and painting. I used to belong to a swimming club and practise swimming a couple of times a week. I have also gone in for some competitions. Painting is one of my hobbies as well, although I do not specialise in it or anything. I'm looking forward to painting beautiful landscapes of California. Last but not at least, what sort of clothes do you think I must bring with me, and is there any laundry system there? Also should I take some money just in case?

According to statistics based on the questionnaire, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native-speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some English classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore, fewer  students were nodding off compared with other classes like Maths. Consequently, it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atmosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of the English department.	According to statistics based on the questionnair, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class.

To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bookworms but also enjoying our school life.

When you go to a  shop it is difficult to find what you are looking for without the help of the shop assistant. The problem is finding a shop assistant who listens to your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any money in cash. So you have wasted hours buying nothing. You can't talk to the manager even to give him suggestions on how to improve his business, because he is always absent.

In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. Actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion. In fact, the shopping you do for your daily needs is seldom enjoyable, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and moreover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need to, shopping can be a very nice activity.

In fact, the shopping you do for the daily needs is seldom enjouble, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and morover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need it, shopping can be a very nice activity.
"Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all that I can using ""on-line"" services."	"Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all what I can using ""on-line"" services."

I can only travel during July because I have a lot of A-level examinations to take during June. I would prefer staying in a tent because I haven't done it before and I would like to give it a go. I would also like to choose basketball and surfing as two activities to do while I am at the Camp. I am very keen on basketball. I am the captain of the school's basketball team and we have won a lot of competitions. However, my surfing ability is very average as I have only been surfing for three months. There are two questions I would like to ask. The first question is how many and what type of clothes do I have to take with me? Another question is how much money do I have to take with me (roughly)?

It was last month that I was selected. I had to help the director write a script for the concert and design the background of the stage. I had also been told that they were going to make a music video of that concert, so I tried as well as I could. I didn't get involved that much in writing the script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea for the background of the stage was mine, and I am very proud of it. Everything was finally  two days before the concert.	It was last month that I was selected. I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and design the background of the stage.

I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance  last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entered the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations in the right place. It was  tiring work because I had to run from place to place  to hang the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting in a good seat to watch the concert.	I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month.

Daily life at my school  is not only school and teachers and mathematics problems. There are  military problems too. We spend a lot of time outside the school during the military things. We must know how to use a gun, or how to drive a tank. That kind of thing should be filmed somehow.	Today there was the sport competition in Basketball.

As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre experiences I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink.

Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.	Believe me, shopping can also be painful.

That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go.

I would like to go in July because it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for accommodation I would prefer to stay in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to go to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to be in the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities for two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing.

I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good, though probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she  might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see disappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any souvenirs of it!	I enjoy shopping like any woman.

I will be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be  enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go during other holidays because for the Easter holiday I need to take part in a Tennis competition  my school and we need time to practise. In the Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going on a  with my relatives. Those are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other time.

I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I said before,  I have to take part in a tennis competition, so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9. Now I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county  when I was 12. I have taken part in 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad encourages me to play tennis and I enjoy it. Regarding climbing, I started to be interested in it when I was 14. My family live near the sea so we get quite a lot of chances to go climbing. I'm not scared of heights and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me.

"As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I liked it and got quite good marks for my project about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether we would be able and willing to help with the concert in two weeks' time in the concert hall. I immediately said ""yes"" and so did my friend. I really thought it sounded so interesting. I had never done light and sound for a real pop concert before and I thought it would be a good experience for me. Actually I'd just done light and sound for a drama day at my school at the end of last term. But this time it'd be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television?"

The preparation days came. On the first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their job was to prepare for the concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amazing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we had to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing a stage, lights, sound and background. I felt like I was one of those professionals too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of things from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always are? It was good fun though!  But my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I did.	The preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came.

A log cabin would be the ideal accommodation. Presumably they are more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing, which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at it. Climbing would be my second option, but for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction because I've only done it a few times.	 will be  ideal accomodation, presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy.

I can't understand these people because this  never happens to me. By the way, usually the people who don't like shopping are men or children.

Because of my business, I am very busy and this  is the best time for my business so I can't organise any time to go on holiday, but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin. As you offered me two activities, I would like to go  swimming. I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be. I have been learning to swim for the last eight months and I have been really enjoying it.

There was a Michael Jackson concert in my city last month. It was a charity concert, which was organised by the university where I am studying. My classmates and I, we were asked  to decorate the stage, and clean the concert area. But guess, Kim, what  the most exciting thing for us was. We were asked to be the singer's interviewer.  just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage. I was so nervous that I couldn't remember what to say. If you imagine yourself talking to a famous pop singer such as him, how do you think you would feel? But what I really enjoyed  that evening was when we had our photographs taken with him after his concert and he signed them for us on the back of each picture.

13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested from me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach  Korean children in Brighton about Korea and Korean history in  early August. Secondly, I would like to stay in log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doesn't mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.	13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition.

How are you my lovely penfriend? Well, I hope. You want to know how it was to work and help at a pop concert? It was marvellous. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them.

It was  hard work for a while but I was so happy  to help at a really big pop concert I can't describe it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and dinner for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I really enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, if not the greatest experience of my life. On the other hand it was a well-paid job at 15 pounds per hour.  What  can you say!

So let's answer the question you asked me to in order to make those two weeks there as much fun as possible. You asked me when I would like to travel to California. Definitely, in July. That's my only month for holidays in the whole year. If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent. I hope . That's the most suitable accommodation for a camping holiday. It  keeps you in touch with nature. That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting. If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first. I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there. Can't say the same about golf. It will be my first experience on the green. I just hope I don't get injured. One thing you have not told me is whether I have to pay for everything myself in California or not. Please, let me know.

As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part in the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me with the task, but that did not make it much easier.

Ten or fifteen years ago we had empty shelves in shops in Poland. We could only buy things from Russia. People always queued for stuff from the west. If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night. It was the worst side of shopping in Poland a couple of years ago. Nowadays we have capitalism, free market, lots of private shops, markets and supermarkets. We can buy everything  we imagine. Polish supermarkets are not Polish-origin shops. They are imported from another Western European country.	Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops. We could only buy things from Russia.

The statement mentioned is perfectly in tune with my opinion. If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop which sells what you are looking for. Once you've found it you should take everything you like and go into the fitting room.	The statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to my opinion.

It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in the right size if the item you took doesn't fit. Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity.

After trying on about twenty different tops, dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly. In the end you may have found only two or three things you really like, but they are worth all the work.

Shopping is great when you have lots of money and time; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CDs, whatever. But it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five). When you work in an office, a factory, a company, you have the same hours as them. So you can only go   shopping during your lunch break. If not, you can go on Saturdays but it's hard, because there are too many customers. You can't walk, or try clothes on, and it's very hot. The saleswomen are too busy and haven't a moment to give you advice.	The shopping is great when you have lots of moneys,  times; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CD, whatever.

I would also like to tell you which two activities I am keen to do at the Camp. One of them is basketball, which I have been playing for over seven years, and I am the captain of my university basketball team. The other one is tennis, which is also my favourite sport and I have been playing for several years. I go to elementary school to teach children how to play tennis every Wednesday and Friday.

First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is look around all the shops and department stores in a city. If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still not find any!! That would be so exhausting.

Next thing you have to do is try them on. You have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms. After that what is waiting for you is the struggle with ill-fitting clothes, taking off and putting on. That's  hell!!	Next thing you have to do is trying them on.

To sum up, although there is certainly a good side to shopping, such as the pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for a long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.

The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable. It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc... It is always the same. You have to find the best article for the best price. You are among thousands of people, but, at the same time, you are alone. Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have chosen, you can believe that the ladies behind the cash desks are unable to smile. After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car. When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again.	The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable.

I suggest filming our English lessons and Maths lessons. From the activities I suggest filming sports lessons and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always working, but as we work, we joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special. It's not true. We practise our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way  they do. Also Maths lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Maths because they think that it's a boring subject. I think it all depends on the teacher. Our Maths teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Maths lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Maths. For activities, we should film sports lessons because we always do something new. We have many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are special. We try to play  many instruments, and sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to watch others while they do something like that.	I suggest to film our English lessons and Math lessons.

The two activities I would like to do are Photography and Sailing. I think they are a good contrast.

I also have some enquiries concerning the trip. I would like to know what the weather is like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothing. I would appreciate it if you also advised me on how much money I should take. It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before.	I also have some enquiries concerning the trip.

I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up on a high street to go shopping. For me, that meant window shopping. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew though that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway.

First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took a long time to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get too excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans.	First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took  long  to finish clearing.

People often have very different opinions about shopping. Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes.

In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange. On the other hand, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when it is  crowded. In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend an hour buying some soap or a packet of biscuits. Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other.

Shopping is part of my life. Sometimes I hate it. I can't  concentrate in a shop, and I can't relax either. I am looking on the shelves but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list.

By the way, last month I was in that pop concert which you mentioned in your last letters. Can you believe it? Actually, I helped  to sell tickets at the reception. I've sold tickets before but not in that kind of big pop concert. Before it was packed into by the audience, we had to clean around the reception, but  it was really exciting although I was just a member of staff in the small reception, because I felt great excitement (especially girls!) from people queueing.

Sometimes, unfortunately shopping can be very annoying, especially at Christmas or Easter time. Then, all shops and supermarkets are crowded. People are trying to buy as many things as they can, and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there! People are pushing each other, they are not as kind as usual. You have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves (they know they can steal something without having been seen!)

During this period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities. Regarding the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin. I think that the cabins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes. The two activities I have chosen are swimming and climbing. I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough at this activity. In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful. I chose climbing because I'm interested in this sport even though I'm not experienced. I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action.	First of all I would like to travel in July.

As you asked me I will write to you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful . Before the concert I helped with carrying and putting in order some chairs on which some special people would sit. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinks to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert.

It was really a very beautiful experience. It offered me more pocket money and besides this I had the chance to make a lot of friends because there were many children who wanted to help too. In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and get a lot of autographs by them. I will never forget these days and I definitely will take part in activities like this in the future.

Firstly, I can only travel in July because I have no time except in July as I am a postgraduate student. I would very much like to stay in a log cabin.

I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time. I would prefer to stay at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air. Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp, which are swimming and photography. Photography is quite interesting for me; I like to take  photographs in a place where I have never been to before. Swimming is quite a nice way to relax and work out. It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming.	I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time.

"Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend  Emma  helped to paint the scenery  on the stage. As you know, I like drawing and painting when I have some free time so that is why I chose to paint the scenery . I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice.

You asked me to write about the experience which I had  helping at the pop-concert. And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said. This included cleaning up the rooms which were used by the singers and putting some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and apply make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could be at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin backstage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his autograph. He was fantastic. You know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge. Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you saw many stars backstage. And you had a chance to speak to some pop-stars. Beside this, I earned some money - not a lot but enough for me.	You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop-concert.

1. The fully equipped computer centre in the main building is extremely good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well.

Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays. In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it.
Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scene: twenty or thirty or even more people are in a queue outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you want to buy a T-shirt?

Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It is a really annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friends, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really bad after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable?

I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a comfortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball for 5 years in an amateur team and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete beginner at surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect opportunity to introduce myself to this exciting sport.

You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the aisles to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is overpriced. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stand up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the  cashier.

"Last month, I had a great time at the concert of ""Dragon"", which is the most popular hard rock group in the world. They had a concert in my home town, that's why the organisers were looking for young people who could speak English. I applied and they took me on. I worked in the security department.

We have more and more shops everywhere and they sell everything. Because of that, people's needs have increased a lot nowadays. That is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. On the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so on. On the other hand, the quality of service in the shops and supermarkets has deteriorated a lot these last few years.

In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the  service in the shops or supermarkets has  a lot those last  years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell.

First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August. I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents. I have once experienced having been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent due to heavy rain several years ago. One more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin, which I have been dreaming of for a long time. How romantic it will be! As for my activities, as I took up playing golf when I was a child and now, I am a single-handicapped player, so I want to have a chance to play golf at camp. Moreover, I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano. In fact I have been playing the piano for a children's choir for 5 years.

As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop maniac. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of an electric shock to his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accidents so I could enjoy the concert without a .

I like shopping very much. Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food from. For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat. Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals. On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive.	I like shopping very much.

The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style by buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop assistants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time.

June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, It was quite nice to hear from you and your family in the last letter you sent me. Hope everybody is well. And, yes! I helped my friend Jane at the concert! It was such a wonderful experience! When Jane asked me to help her with  the publicity and specially with the interviews, I just couldn't believe it. You know that I love going to concerts, but being at the beginning of  the show and a member of the staff was something I was always interested in. I never imagined how many people are involved in the organization of a concert! In the area of publicity we were about 50 guys, all of us investigating, calling  radio stations, organizing the reporters, specifying where the press would be for the interview that took place afterwards... yet, it was  incredibly satisfying when everything turned out just fine! Wish you were there! But, I heard you went on vacation to Bermuda. Cool! How was it? You have to tell me everything! Looking forward to hearing from you.

I was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked  to help at the pop concert which took place in my town. The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who do art, to help decorate the stage. Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop singers and bands whom we would be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school.

When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipment for the concert. We were all given different sorts of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practising on the stage. At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autographs from our favourite pop singers.

As you know, Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed to be accompanied. When we arrived she persuaded me to go  backstage because her boyfriend was the band's electrician. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted anyway because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play.  Just then Ake exclaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun to learn but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune.

I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends, which normally is the only appropriate time! Not only are shops crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queues. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side to 'shopping'.

I do agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because of crowded shops and the price of clothes but I am sure that the majority of people do like shopping and I am sure that in the future there will be no more crowded streets because of the 'Internet,' on which you can order online. Maybe we will have robots to do the shopping for us in the future!

I like speaking activity while I am in the class. During that time I can talk about some secret or private things with classmates. After that we know each other better than before. In addition speaking activity includes everything for learning English such as listening, speaking, and grammar as well. In other lessons, the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammar, English culture... etc. It might be good. However, all the students are passive. So it can be boring. Give a topic and then discuss  it. I know  what my friends think and like. . Also the film must be funny. If a film is boring, nobody will watch it. During speaking, there are lots of things happening such as, some students can't understand what the other students say and their culture. Having fun and acquiring new knowledge. It makes us laugh.

THE RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING	 RIGHT TIME FOR SHOPPING
Why do people like shopping? The first answer is that they need to go shopping. The second answer is that  shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel like going shopping. When I go shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but only if it is possible to do the shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for.	Why do people like shopping?

I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping. I went shopping last week with my friend, she needed to buy a nightdress. We spent  three hours and we couldn't buy anything.

Unfortunately, the only month I can travel is July because I'm doing my final exams at university in June and then starting a job in August. Any two weeks during July will suit me perfectly. The best time would be from 17th July till 30th July. As for accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a tent. I'm used to sleeping in a tent from my previous holidays and I always enjoyed it. I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are  and how many people are there in one tent.

I really appreciate the choice of activities at the camp. It was hard to choose only two. I've chosen tennis and sailing. I've played tennis since I was eight years old and I'm very good at it. I'm also good at swimming and surfing but I'd like to try sailing. I have always been attracted to it but never had an opportunity to try. Is it possible to start to learn it at Camp California?

In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert.

The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning.

When they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had their hands full with teenage girls who had fainted. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they fainted, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the unconscious. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the sight of crying and shaking but completely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor.

As you know, I helped at a pop concert last month. I did things as unusual for me as cleaning instruments, organising people, and also looking after the artists' clothes.

Organising people involved just a couple of things, telling people how to do the same as me and when.

Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort.  that doing a sport or even going to work requires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money.

However, this apparently quiet and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her.

The concert was absolutely marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious. Anyway, what you wanted to know was what my job was. Actually my job was not really stressful, but I had contact with and access to all the famous pop stars. I had to bring them refreshments. That has been my dream since my childhood.

I was a little bit disappointed with their attitude. They didn't really appreciate the service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience.

I find shopping is very time consuming. If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes, I have to go into a city centre and browse around from shop to shop until I find the shoes I like.

Whilst in London, I'll be facing crowds and people will be rushing everywhere. To walk around London streets looking for a pair of shoes can definitely be a tiring task.

It was terrible! We had a lot of problems from the beginning. The first one was the security. The people in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to. If it hadn't been a calm and quiet crowd, we would have had trouble. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the venue was crowded. So the concert started an hour and a half late.	It was terrible! We have a lot of problems from the beggining. The first one was the security.

As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - for both of which I helped carry things - were appropriate for the concert. Despite all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the best experience I've ever had.

We arrived at the stadium the evening before. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help with anything they needed done.

They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the stage was being prepared for the concert.	We arrived at the stadium the previous evening.

For example, you walk into a shoe store. Two assistants are talking and, although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them. Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other assistant. There is nothing more disagreeable than that.	For example, you walk into a shoe store.

I think the people who enjoy shopping  are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life. They are wasting time in their life for nothing.

A couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend, who is into music, and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing. She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge concert by a singer who is a well-known pop star as well as my favourite.

It was like a dream come true, and was the best part of the experience in my opinion. I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments.

I would like to travel only in July because in August I have to study for an exam. Further I would prefer to stay in a tent at the camp, because I am already used to that, because I often spend my holidays in tents. I would like to do painting, because one of my greatest hobbies is silk painting and so I think I can improve my abilities. The second activity which I choose is playing basketball, because I love this wonderful sport. We always play it at school and I am very good at it. I am in our school basketball team.

My first task was to open the doors to let in all the Britney Spears fans. I stood at the entrance and there I had to check the tickets. Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both of them! I had to tell one of them that she had to leave. She started crying. Such a poor girl! At that moment I didn't like my position.	My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears. I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets.

As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a new sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fascinating to challenge the waves. I wish I could learn to be better so that I could enjoy it more in the future.	As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list.

That was a pop concert of Steps in  M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean.
"A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking whether everything was going well according to the timetable. If something comes up, she should inform the other staff. I was then taken on to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different times on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to the other staff. They were very helpful and nice.

Even though I would like to travel, I am only available in July, because I am a high school student. Thus I have not got a long holiday. I just have one month . Personally, I would rather stay in log cabins than in tents. On account of the fact that staying in log cabins is  much more interesting than staying in tents. As far as two activities are concerned, I would choose singing and photography. I used to win a number of competitions in singing. I can sing  plenty of songs, which include  English songs and the Japanese songs, and I have a part-time job  singing at a restaurant. Although  photography is not as good as  singing, I am very interested in it. I have been studying photography since I was 15 years old. I got third prize in a competition last year and my level is professional now. Furthermore, I am going to enter a competition next year.

The first thing is the location of the shops. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time. The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open. Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go  shopping. The third thing is the crowds. Everybody does their shopping at the same time and often in the same place. It is almost a battle to buy different things and  to pay for those things. People are often irritable and aggressive. Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women.	The first thing is the place of shopping. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time.

The things I did were: preparing and checking the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, making sure that all the lights were in perfect working order, that the singers were comfortable and relaxed, etc.	Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing.

",,Shopping is not always enjoyable"". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money in our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who, with a smile on their faces, spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbour jealous."	",,Shopping is not always enjoyable"".

The next things to be shot, according to the majority of students, should be the teaching process and the breaks.

Here I should also mention the decor of our classrooms and the atmosphere in them.

I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July. This is because it falls on my  holidays and  it is also summer in America. This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and experience.

Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up  close to nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.	Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent.

Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have a lot of experience with swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.

Last but not least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear. I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring. Will I be going out much, or just staying in Camp California all the time?

The concert was held in our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.	The concert was held at our school hall.

I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to install new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.	I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment.

In the first place, some housewives don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second. To make matters worse, you realise you have forgotten to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket.

Another argument against shopping is the lack of  items that you really want. Sometimes  you see a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold  or there isn't one left in your size. I cannot imagine anything worse.

The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay for everything you buy on your credit card. When the bill comes to £1000, you will be shocked and regret what you have done.

My final question is this. Can you let me know if there are any facilities for washing my clothes? If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks.

I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday it is not the same. The shops are so crowded and it takes a long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we have to face a long queue in order to pay. It is tiring for some people to spend long hours shopping. I find it very tiring sometimes.

The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them.
"In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude towards them. In some ways, he did not agree with ""Black Consciousness"" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist. In other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa."

Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you in reply to your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer , and there will be nice weather to enjoy in California. Secondly, I would prefer  to stay in a log cabin, because I am allergic to some insects that might get in a tent. As regards the activities, I would enjoy tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have learnt some techniques that I would like to put into practice. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where I can change my money to American dollars cheaply. I would like to ask for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell	Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you, in reply for your letter.

Firstly, you need to know what you are doing. I spent two weeks preparing  the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show. I could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff. The day of the concert, everyone, including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired. However, when the concert started, we saw that all our efforts had been worthwhile. The crew and artists thanked the staff.	Firstly, you need to know, and be  of what you are doing.

The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the show. And I didn't even get paid. But it was worth it. I got my reward when the concert finished. After  carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was exhausted. But when Britney came off the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me into her personal dressing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write to me soon to tell me your thoughts about what happened to me. Bye.	The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the spectacle.

Dear Helen Ryan: Thank you for letting me know about my prize trip to Camp California in the USA. Here I will answer all the questions that you asked me, and I will ask you about other things that you didn't mention. I'd like to organize my trip for July because that is when I have vacations, also because it is summertime in the U.S.A. About accommodation at Camp I'd prefer a tent, because it's a new experience for me and I'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure. In my free time I like to play golf and swim, so I think that I'm good at playing golf. I play every Saturday and Sunday and, after that, I usually go to the pool because I love swimming. I think that those are the sports I would like to do at the Camp. Helen, I would like to ask you how much money we have to take to the Camp? What kind of clothing do we have take? Thank you very much for your cooperation. Yours sincerely Teresa Reina	Dear Helen Ryan: Thank you for letting me know about my prize  to Camp California in the USA.

About accommodation, I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are cleaner than the tents.

From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me. I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens. For men, sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners. Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town. And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like, the sports shop. You cannot waste  time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive. And that is always what we want. That's men's intention.	From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me.

Another point is to go to a big area, especially at weekends. Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around. People should have to get a licence to drive those things. Someone could be injured. And of course, the time to pay. A huge queue that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out. In conclusion, for me, to go shopping is not enjoyable at all.

Usually people don't have time for shopping. You've just finished your long hours at work, you are tired, you had a row with your boss but you are still going to go shopping. And what do you have?

For example, a lot of people do not like to go shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varieties of products, different prices, different qualities. You will have to walk miles around the store to find what you want. Yes, there is a big plus with a big store of course. You can find everything in one place, in contrast to the small shops which specialise in one product. And people spend all weekend walking around shopping centres and high streets in  to buy something.	For example a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores.

At the camp I would like to choose two activities, Painting and Singing. I love painting. At  university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint because I work in a bank and I have a baby. So I will be very happy to improve my art at the camp. The reason for my choice of singing is that I feel embarrassed about my voice, so maybe I could improve it.

You are never going to believe what I did last month.

We said yes immediately. I nearly shouted with happiness when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert. He is my favourite singer.

There are people that love going  shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted to buying things.

Many people, especially women, love shopping. If you go to the centre of any big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat. But shopping is not always enjoyable.	Many people, especially women, love shopping.

First of all because of the great variety in the store, very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sports shoes to choose from, no, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, Adidas or Fila.

Of course there are a lot of other reasons why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last reason, which is very important for me, is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complain to. That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in small stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about.

I learned painting when I was a school student. In particular, I like water painting. Also, I belonged to a golf club when I went to university in Japan.	First, I would like to travel during July.

I would like to go on the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. The other reason is, I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather conditions will be suitable for camping. I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabin because sleeping in a tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to  nature. Every night I would like to go out of the small tent into the nice environment outside the tent. Also, staying in a tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be careful about insects so I've bought so many insect repellants. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and go swimming. When I was in the fourth form, I got the first prize in a swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disappointed with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or second prize.

I had to help them behind the stage, while they were getting dressed. I had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly. Although the work was not hard, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their autographs and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the stage and dance with them. I was really embarrassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that was the very best experience I have ever had. I  really enjoyed  the concert.

Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins. I think I like both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two . I am very interested in both  but, I can just choose one . I think I will choose log cabins; they sound good and if I have time, maybe I can stay in tents next time (maybe next year).

When I go shopping, I always feel ashamed because I spend my parents' money. (Although I have got a part-time job, it provides just enough to pay my rent.)

Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very surprised to win this prize. About the information, I would like to travel in July because it's only the month when I have a vacation.

At the camp I would like to play tennis and golf. My level in these two activities is medium. I never  them both. I would like to ask you some questions.	Thank you very much for your letter.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable. Last weekend I went to Barcelona with some friends to shop. When we arrived at the shopping centre, I saw a lot of people. I don't understand why there were a lot of people. My friends and I went to a clothes shop - ""Mango"" - to buy some clothes. Nobody in the shop came with us to help. There were four guys, in this shop. We asked them if one of them could help us. Finally, a very friendly girl came with us. We bought some trousers, tee-shirts, and one pair of shoes. My friends bought some things like  red trousers and white tee-shirts. After this, we returned to Andorra. But it's not always the same story because I like shopping and I think I'm . The people in the shops are not unfriendly all the time. "	"Shopping is not always enjoyable. Last weekend I went to Barcelona with some friends to shop.

You asked me when I would like to travel? I would like to travel only in July because in August I must go to my grandmother's and help  her to gather a harvest of fruit. I'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent. And with the tent I can go to another place in the camp. When it rains it is not comfortable, but I like it. I want to do  activities like basketball, because I think it is a teenager's game. And I like painting because I like to paint  nature, sea, mountains. I often go to  exhibitions of paintings of modern artists. But I like different styles of art. I think I'll enjoy this trip.

"I abolutely agree with this, because I have my own experience of shopping. For example, recently I was shopping at the market, which is located in the centre of our town. And what do you think? When I was there I saw a very beautiful T-shirt. I asked my mother to buy it. But my mother said: ""I haven't enough money to buy it"". I was upset about it. Our government is very bureaucratic. Our ministers are really criminal. They  often break the law, stealing money. For example, Paul Kozin stole 800000000 dollars. Because of it our state can't pay  workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. In our country there is a high number of unemployed. Often people can't buy a piece of bread. And they ask for money from other people. My parents can't buy me . Each man thinks only about himself. The quality of life is very low."	" absolutly agree with it.

As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school. Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest filming Mr. Clark's English classes, because they are highly educational and because the students participate a lot. On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be sufficient to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard.

On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard.
One event that should not be missed  is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should definitely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen. The cooks are very friendly and excellent.

They were giving two concerts, one on Friday and the other one on Saturday. They invited me to go on Friday. This is what happened: when I arrived they told me that I was helping  backstage with the scenery; then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes, then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the curtains (opening and closing) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him. My heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day.

"Many classes and activities are important in our school. But I have to make a choice in order to select from among them. The engineering class seems to be the most important lesson.

Besides it  all the areas covered by a mechanical engineer and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mechanical engineer. It lets us identify our abilities and the part of mechanics that we prefer. But there are other very important lessons (like English of course!)

Dear Madam,	Dear Madame,
I have received your letter about the competition 'two weeks at Camp California' - I am very glad to know that I have won the first prize! In the following you can find, I hope, all the information you need to complete the enrolment procedure. I would like to travel only in July because, as you already know, at the moment I am following a doctoral course at  Cornell University: the school is closed in July and so, in that period, I am available for the camp. If possible, the type of accommodation I prefer is a tent. There are two main reasons for this choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the related activities: putting up the tent, cooking  and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the daily life of the camp (the tent, the sleeping bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like  water sports and I am quite a good guitarist and singer. Some questions: what is the average temperature at the camp in July? What are the best clothes to wear at the camp? How much money will I need at the camp?

Our school, as  is well known, is a technical school and consequently its daily life consists of different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories. A short video, shown to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school. Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed for the video. The maths lessons are divided in two parts: the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained. Two particular activities are performed in the physics laboratory and the chemistry laboratory. In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant. In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated. These activities are very interesting and they will surely be included in the video.

On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk  and have to endure endless queues.

As if this were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse.

Dear Helen Ryan:	Dear Helen Ryan;

Regarding the two activities, I choose swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much. I took swimming lessons for four years.

For example, all shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping on weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.	For example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends.

However, people can't have a good time even on weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get.

Sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything. But of course, there are some exceptions. For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never see it again, or you could be robbed, or  if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time.

What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well.

First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has its own idea of where it wants to go) between other desperate people's baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or some toothpaste. Especially as it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department store. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop ends in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that?

I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in a log cabin.

Given the circumstances, they asked me  to help in the kitchen. You can imagine how disappointed I was. But it turned out to be a fun and interesting job. I had to prepare the ingredients for every meal. That meant I had to read the recipes very carefully. And I had to check that nothing was missed. The best thing was that I got a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks.  I had a lot to do and I was never bored. The people were all really funny and we were a good team.

About the trip, I think it would be preferable to do it in July, which is a holiday period and so I won't have any  obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can be closer to  nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do, especially during a holiday! Moreover I would like it if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little  of this kind would be great.

From the first moment that I got there I understood that I was going to have a great night. OK, in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do, such as cleaning the stage and  some decoration work. But when the concert started and we finished what we had to do, we were free to do whatever we wanted. So the party started... The pop concert was excellent and I had a lot of fun. Don't ask the time when I came home because I don't remember! Some of my friends who were also helping told me that we returned at six o'clock in the morning! It was really an unforgettable experience.	From the first time that  went there I understood that I was going to have a great night.

I have just received your letter and I am so pleased with the news. I'd like to tell you that the best month for me to travel to the U.S.A. is  July because I will be on holiday in that month. I don't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California, but if I can  I'll choose to stay in a tent. This is because it will be more exciting and fun than  in log cabins. From the list of activities  at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming. I used to go to a swimming pool twice every week and also I love music and sing all the time.

I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy. I mean we just carried all the instruments of the musicians to the Club and we put them on the stage. After this, we helped at the  bar, putting all the drinks and refreshments into the fridges. And that was it! I enjoyed doing this a lot and  the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. Marvellous!	I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band.

For my activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it.  I used to enter  competitions when I was younger. And for the other activity I will choose tennis. I really enjoy this sport. I am not really a good player but I like to play tennis in my free time! Since I'm coming in the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me?  And I have another question. It's about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have cash or cheques?

Well this is absolutely true, especially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowded, and most of the people are stressed.  It's crazy. For example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have it and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you have chosen. And you have to wait after that to buy it, so finally you have waited so long that you have become late, so you get stressed too. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus, most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their kids' names in the shopping mall because they have lost them. So you get a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling.  If I can give you some advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruises because of the woman who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!

Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular.

Really? Sometimes things can go wrong and the situation changes and becomes a nightmare. Firstly there is the parking problem. If you go  shopping late at weekends for instance, it's really difficult to find a place to park your car, and when you get a place, you have to pay for it! Then the search for a nice item of clothing starts, and when eventually you get it, it isn't your size, and also the colour that you like is not available. Finally you've found  something really wonderful - time to pay!	Really? Sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare.

In the hurry you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use your plastic money. The shop assistant passes the credit card through the machine, after a few seconds he does it again, and does it another time . Suddenly his face changes and he tells you that the card is faulty! No choice: you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad.

I wish you had been there with me helping at a pop concert. I just loved it. I was working with this music system. You know how good I am at musicAnyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. At the beginning I was connecting all these wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us. I asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your tv on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing  this guitar. AH, it was lovely. These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see this pop concert. Believe me, you'll love it and you might play the drums.

However there are some problems that I hope to solve. First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July. It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I cannot let my patients down.

It's hard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable. Probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly and you can't have it.

I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month.

June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, As you already know, I was at a pop concert last month. It was great! The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcome. The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set up the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthwhile for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you. Best wishes	June 13th, 2000 Dear Kim, As you already know, I was at a pop concert last month. It was great! The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcomed.

I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher, George, are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate . Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I  that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Also the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with their delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures would be amazing and wonderful.

"""Wuthering Heights"" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very accurate summary in the case of my book because the main character in the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than the others due to his complex mind and his deep, evil ways. He's the richest character of all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason for whatever happens to the other characters. They are always suffering from the vengeance that Heathcliff is sworn to, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other characters have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated for his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this tendency to harm but because the other characters have made him like that. This revenge links the story together so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important aspect of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them."

Some people seem to enjoy going shopping and spending money. It makes them happy.

It happened to me once.  I wanted to go on holiday, so I went to the travel agency. In the window there were some good advertisements about holidays which were very cheap. I really liked one of them concerning a holiday in Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, for only £250. I went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone, so, I went to many shops just to get the same answer. None of the adverts in the windows were available. However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that advert out of the window they didn't do it.

The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular thing for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you. Eventually, after long searching you find a skirt you like. But it doesn't fit. You get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one. And finally, after a few more hours, you buy the skirt of your dreams. And suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop. An accident like that can really make you livid. At last you come back home, carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town. You phone your friend to visit you and your friend comes, wearing a skirt not unlike the one you have just bought.

My best friend is crazy about shopping. She prefers shopping to everything else. She thinks that it is the most pleasant way of spending time, when you go from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas. Sometimes I feel very sorry for her. It seems that going shopping is a reason for living. And there're so many people like her. Lots of families plan a day out to go to a shopping centre, and it is a normal routine for them - to spend  all day just shopping. Not so many people think about going fishing or playing  games with their families any more. They have forgotten how beautiful the countryside can be, and you can only meet tourists in the castles or museums.	My best friend is crazy about shopping.

The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many people from the countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most about this experience? I found pop music so wonderful, it changed my opinion  that classical music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too.

Do you remember when I told you that my dream was to help Mano's group? Well, my dream came true. It all started when I was at Drama Club and my singing teacher told me that Mano's group were going to have a concert here, in Argentina. She also told me that she has some connections with the people in charge of the lights at the concert. You know that last year I organised the lights at our performance. So, there I was, controlling the illumination of Mano's concert!!!!	Do you remember when I told you that my dream was helping Mano''s group? Well, my dream come true.

Firstly, I would like to inform you that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in any other month. The reason for this is that July is the only month in which I am on holiday so I will not have to miss any classes. Next, I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than stay in a log cabin because I appreciate having close contact with nature. Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities  which I am good at. I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be  first in all the competitions and as for climbing I used to climb trees, walls, everything in my childhood without falling.

"Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you could talk face-to-face with the pop stars. Moreover, you had the unique opportunity to have your picture taken with them, to have their names written on your notebook by them. Despite  being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and it is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for your work and it is  good money. Don't worry because you don't pay for your ticket, it is ""free"". From my point of view, there were no disadvantages."

'As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.

There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping. You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need. You could also buy something which later turns out to be broken. So you have to complain about it. Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time.

"Sometimes when you ask your friend, especially girls, ""What would you like to do after the class or during the weekend?"" the typical answer would be 'I'm going to the shop because I like it, even window shopping would be fine'. However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable. Why? First of all, it wastes my time, especially when I can't find the thing I want. This is very frustrating. In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to  the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got everything on your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought, which are very heavy sometimes."	Sometime when you ask your friend especially girls.

First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. This is because I intend to take an examination in September. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time experiencing staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried.

"Hello! I hope everything around you is alright. You might not believe it but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much. So I'm now writing to let you know how great it was. All the work I needed to do wasn't very interesting.  I must have set thousands of chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practising. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of the stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as a member of the audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never sat down there. Additionally, you won't believe it, but the vocalist said ""All the chairs you are sitting  on were set out by him,"" pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory."	"Hello! I hope everything around you is alright.

Thank you for your letter. I was very surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition.

We  always enjoyed ourselves. Never had I had such a great time. From your list of activities I choose sailing and climbing. I'm keen on sailing, it is my favourite sport. I find it very appealing. I have been sailing since my father  bought a boat in 1980, when I was only five years old. However, I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport. For me it is only a hobby. Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport.	We had always enjoying ourselves. Never had I got such a great time.

I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantages of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything  they want. It isn't true. Nowadays we have many big shopping centres. We like them because everything is in one place. The most suitable time for shopping is the weekend when parents don't work and children haven't got  school. Because of that, shopping centres are overcrowded. You can't buy something in a peaceful and calm atmosphere. In addition, in this kind of shops prices are very high, of course not all of them. However such centres are very useful and necessary. In my opinion the worst thing which may happen is an extremely long queue for the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping can be enjoyable. If you bought something gorgeous, you will be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you are in a bad mood don't go shopping.

Why do people like to go shopping so much?	Why  people like so much go shopping?
In my opinion the majority of  people who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for their families, so, for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated every day and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money.

On the other hand, there are people who think the opposite, such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they hardly ever go shopping -  only when they need clothes, or something for their job or school. In that way shopping can be as much fun as you want, although if you do it very often, it will .	, there are people who think the opposite; such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go  hardly ever, only when they need clothes or something for their job or school.

To sum up, everything you do in small quantities is good and fun, but don't increase the amount you do if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.	To sum up, all you make in small cuantities is good and funny, but don't encrease them if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.

From my point of view, shopping is not always enjoyable, because sometimes when you are looking for a special item you never find it. Besides, I do not like to waste my time just looking at a wide variety of products, that makes you feel confused, and you don't know which item fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else.

Besides, I do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products, that make you feel confused and you don't know which one fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else.
I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Especially in the shops that sell fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times when it really becomes tiring.

To summarize, I would say that if you want to buy something, first make sure what sort of product you need and then go shopping. If you don't shopping will never be enjoyable, but only tiring and boring.

Dear Helen Ryan, I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me for some details. I'd like to travel in July. Because I am a university student, I have got classes until the middle of June and I have to attend  a 'Research and Development Conference' at the end of June. Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as an assistant from the beginning of August. So I will be able to travel in July. Accommodation is very important for me as well. I would prefer staying in log cabins. I've got some skin trouble and I can't sleep very well in tents. I have  slept in tents when I went camping. That time I had to sleep in a tent. The whole night, I felt backache and shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well. And I've never stayed in log cabins. It sounds wonderful! Could I have the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp? I'd very much like to do painting and swimming. I am quite good at painting. I especially love watercolours. I really want to paint the countryside of California. It will be a fantastic experience for me. Actually I can't swim at all. I'm afraid of water. That is why I can't swim yet. I think this is a very good chance for me to learn to swim. I expect to join the above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for clubbing or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. I'm going to buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Yours sincerely	Dear Helen Ryan.

Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into  every shop.

One day I decided to go to the shopping centre which is only 40 metres from our house. Firstly, I could not find the entrance. I'd walked around for about 15 minutes until I found the door.

You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month? I must say that was  great fun. I'd never had this kind of experience before. Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets. They were lists of pop bands and groups which would appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds. After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but couldn't find their seat. During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had a chance to see most of the performance. That was excellent. I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars. During the break time I did give a lot of directions to people who couldn't find the toilet, and gave people information such as where they could have a cup of coffee. That was a bit boring, but it was part of my job.	You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping  last month?

My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was a most exciting job.

First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The musical instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them in the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important to the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in the flesh.	First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived.

There are, in contrast, disadvantages at the same time. When we are   shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for  shopping is too crowded and it makes us more tired. Also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people. In addition, shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secretly. The customer can never know what price is the normal one unless they have the same shop or the same thing.

As far as camp activities are concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years and, for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing.

Everyone has likes and dislikes. But no one does what he likes all the time. There are times when you have to do something even if you don't like it, and times when you are doing what you like but not at the time you would like to. What I'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I can't do that all the time. First because I'm not so rich and second because I don't enjoy shopping all the time. Nothing in life is always enjoyable, not even the things we enjoy doing, and that's how life is. You say you enjoy shopping. I understand but life goes on. You can't do the same things every day. Live your life and try to do different things and you will see that doing different things is exciting and more fun. You don't have to be bored with the same old things.

If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine  could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill  time and sometimes you do not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people are enjoying themselves a lot.

On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For example if you are a working mother with three children, which means you are always in a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You shop in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.

I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable. For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy. We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons). They had invited us and we wanted them to see us looking stunningly beautiful.

While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsy. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, its accessories and also clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs. I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop.

We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things. For example, food. You will not be able to survive without food. So buying necessary things is fine I think. But buying things that you do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them. For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking. But afterwards you never eat them and just bin them.

As you asked me some questions, here are the answers. It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays. If you agree I would like to have a tent for my accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder if it might be a great feeling and if in this way I will be in closer contact with the animals that live in the area.

It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the singer fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the singer, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. About an hour later, he recovered and the show began.

I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shops in the centre of a big town. These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example. In such  shops there is usually one or one or two sales assistants, which is not enough when a shop is full of people. That's a place where you lose too much  time and health.

It's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest of the time, because I enjoy swimming and it doesn't matter where - in the lake or swimming pool. I think it's a very useful and helpful thing for my health, especially when I do it with pleasure. The second of my favourite sports is tennis. I've played tennis for ten years. I'm a professional and I have to be good at it,  time.

Now I want to tell you about a pop concert. As you already know I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some advice about suits and dresses. Often we saw rehearsals and if something didn't appeal to us we tried to correct it. The most enjoyable thing was to dress people. We have a good and rich sponsor. That's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that piece of clothing which we thought was most suitable for their style. We always explained things to them and in the end they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how loudly the audience applauded them we were proud and understood that we . You should try it and see. I'll be waiting for your answer.

Being a woman, I naturally love shopping.

However, there are a few times  when you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period. Shops are incredibly crowded. You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it, or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn. In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because the shops run out of products very quickly. Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other months.

Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable is when you go shopping with a man. For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world. A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress on and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes.

The large list of interesting activities that you offer is incredible. It's difficult just to choose two but if I have the chance I would like to do sailing and photography.

Well, it was quite fun while I was helping them to do the stuff before the concert started. I had to get everything that they needed up  the stairs. It was so tiring. Then after that I had to help them carry all the clothes for the singer to wear from the bus down into the staff room. I saw Westlife too. You know they are so cute. Then I could take a rest for about 30 mins. After that I had to go into the staff room again because they wanted me to go and buy some drink for the singer. After I came back I had to help them clean all the make-up stuff. The concert began... That meant I could take a rest until the concert finished. After the concert had finished I had to help them again to clean all the stuff, I had to carry everything that I could carry back to the bus. We were so tired but it was good fun. I think this experience was quite interesting. If somebody asked me to go and help again I would like to go for sure.

There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like. All this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were queuing to pay. If this wasn't enough your strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when, despite having been robbed, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry, you finally buy something you really like with your credit card and, after having walked a few blocks, you see the same item at half the price in another shop.

Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours  shopping and not find what you are looking for, perhaps because it is not in your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable for you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms, where you wait standing up for your turn. After that, there is the unfriendly and sometimes impolite shop assistant who gets on your nerves . But never mind! The worst is when you get  home in the evening and find a chair to sit in because your feet are killing you and you realize you have spent all your money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.

But never mind! the worst  when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit  because your feet are killing you and  realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.

I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's favourite activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body.

"Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I'd won a competition. I was so happy and surprised that first I could not really believe it.  But it was true. My prize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at their concert. The pop group which was going to play is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to). But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. It started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering, which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I was not able to eat anything either. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guided tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I realised that they were very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and, I have to tell you, they gave a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like ""Did you like the performance?"" or ""What do you think about the first group?"" Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean.  They were not conceited or anything like that. They were like  other people and I have to admit that I like them very much.

I do agree with this statement. One of the most unforgettable habits of city life is going out  shopping. I used to hang around famous clothes shops looking at the new new-arrivals clothes section. It is not only  good fun to see the new fashions and things but it also decreases the amount of money in my pocket.	In my opinion, I do agree with this expression.

Sometimes shopping doesn't do anything for you but only wastes all your free time. A group of girls can stay in a shopping centre forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexes nowadays are more attractive and combine every facility inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy.	Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time.

I have happily received your reply  and I want to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only month of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks. I would like a log cabin because I think you should provide me with good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity or entertainment. I would like to play basketball and tennis . I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good at it. As to tennis I'm the best player in my whole school and, once, I got into the top 10 of my country's  tennis players.

How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up onto the stage and, believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands. I'll never wash my hand again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon.	How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here.

It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities.

Dear Kim, I want to tell you about a good experience I had last month. I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it was fabulous. At first, I helped them to carry the equipment and we fixed everything in the correct order. There were so many pieces that we spent a whole day preparing the stage. At the end, we had a beer and we talked together. I was astonished to see how friendly and funny they were and we became good friends. During the show, I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping . It was unbelievable to think that I'd worked with stars and that they were my friends. It is difficult to explain what I particularly liked about my experience because  and I'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people whom I'd known only for a few days.

"Benoni's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels, Belgium.

Students start their day at the Gym, where they learn the importance of being fit, that is why I suggest filming this activity. Once students have taken a shower after  hard physical training they enter real life. Depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study  languages which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. Students have to manage to speak at least three languages.

In addition, I would like to travel in July because my school will have finished that month so I will be able to go on holiday. And if it is possible, I would rather be accommodated in log cabins because I would not like to share the bathroom facilities with someone who I do not know well. Thank you for asking me to choose from the list of  activities.  I am in the school swimming team and I am interested in photography professionally. Therefore I would like to improve my skills and knowledge in these subjects during my holiday. Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me and whether the company offers us some  money to spend?

Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would  spend my entire life  shopping. Although I am someone who loves shopping, I cannot stand  . However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and at the same time. It leads to overcrowded shops, high-pitched noise, a lack of parking places and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole thing is just about enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not avoid  shopping on those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special services, such as sending your order by  post or taking it on the telephone. It could be the way to avoid busy times or days. Do not take your child with you; choose the right shop which has a car park.

I have received your letter: I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California. I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long, except during July, so that is the only month in which I can travel. I would be grateful if I could stay in a log cabin: I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height; I am so tall that I could never stand up. I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be advisable not to stop training  during July. I can play basketball very well. I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf. I have never tried this sport, so I can't play golf at all.

I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school day, we should film the large number of sports activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm.

Only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek poetry lesson because the Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotions they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone....

Do you remember the concert I helped at? It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans. We started at 7 pm to let them into the concert area. I had to tear off a part of every single ticket. This part had to be saved for later because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors. After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my  and went to help at the security section. Here, I had to check the bags and coats of the girls. Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things in with them, like knives or scissors. So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags. I really felt like a security guard.	Do you remember the concert I helped at. It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans.

And for me, I think a tent would be better. I don't know why but I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed in log cabins, and when I was sleeping I felt something moving on my skin, then I woke up frightened and when I opened my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed in a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why!	And for me, I think  tents would be better, I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable.

"I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop (I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday), when I found a beautiful store. I stopped in front of it and started looking at the window display (outside), then I thought it was interesting and went in. Suddenly, I saw a man with a cap covering his face. I tried to look again to see him better, because he seemed to be very handsome. And then he said, ""If you promise me you won't go out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I'm here, I will take this cap off of my face."" I didn't know what to do. I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murderer! Then I said, ""OK, I promise!"" (frightened, of course). Carefully, he took off the cap. Tina, guess WHO he was? Ricky Martin!! Can you believe it! And there's more! He asked me if I could help at his concert here in São Rafael. Because the store manager told him that I was the best hairdresser in the city! And his hairdresser was sick, so he and his producers were looking for one. Isn't that amazing? I met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of photographs with me and gave me an autographed Record. Tina, I'm the luckiest girl in the world, don't you think? I'll send you some photos."	"I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop.

Generations of young South Africans, black, white or brown, will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through. Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always. Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of those dark years - a peaceful man who was caught up in the wiles of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally  and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force.

I would like to travel in July because my examinations will be finished on June 15th. And I have a plan to go to visit my parents in Bangkok, Thailand, in the middle of August. So, I think July is the best time to go to the Camp. In addition, the weather may be nice at that time of year. For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I am used to them. Because I'm not good at sport,  I will choose singing and photography as my activities. When I was studying at  university I joined the Photo Club where I know-how taking photos. As I love singing and always spend my free time doing Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad.	I would like to travel in July because my examination will be finished on June 15th.

"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to go shopping a lot when I was at  university. I was 19 years old but I spent over 200 pounds  some weeks just to keep myself fashionable all the time. I bought lots of new, fashionable clothes, bags and shoes. For four years at  university I never had any savings."	"""Shopping is not always enjoyable"". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to do shopping a lot when I was in the university.

Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young, as mentioned. So I came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste  time and money. I found that it's not worthwhile when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson. They were very poor. The money that I spent on shopping could have helped them a lot if I had not spent it already.  His little grandson tried to help his grandfather, who was 70 years, old by working as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old. This thing told me shopping was not enjoyable any more.

Generally, women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on. In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who are keen on finding stuff which is good value for money. You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes. The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping. They don't fancy going into the crowded shop. It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting.	Generally women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on.

"Dear Kim; How are you? It's been a long time since I last wrote to you. Anyways, do you remember my last e-mail, where I told you that I was going to help at a Pop Concert. Well, I'm going to tell you about that awesome experience. The band played at my school so we could raise money for our graduation trip. I asked them if they could play at our school and they told me it would be 350 pounds. ""The Moicznos"" are so popular that we sold  every ticket and ended up making 2000 pounds. Apart from calling them, I also helped build  the stage, and took care of the lights. After the concert the whole class helped clean up the mess the people left. I can tell you that it was a wonderful experience. What I liked the most about it is not the fact that we raised a lot of money, but that we enjoyed  an amazing show in which I took an active part.

Of course it allows us to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want). For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life? Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away? It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone. Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialling home to ask which salad to buy?	Of course it allows  to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.)

Firstly, I would like to tell you that the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located beside the congress house in the centre. You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury  06 8793888. Secondly, the best way to get from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which has been specially organized by us. The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening. Of course there's also a number 8 bus,  in front of the hotel, which is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour.

First of all, the efficiency of  society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait for the cashier to  by hand. When booking a flight, we can just make a phone call to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of  tons of books to get the information that we need, we can very easily search for it on the Internet or on the local network. It's  very often heard that someone who has a rare illness has had an operation at a foreign institute which he found via the Internet. Moreover, with computer networks, it is possible for people to work from home,  projects, controlling operations or  conferences. Lastly  has also changed. Instead of  traditional telecommunications, we can talk by, e-mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network.	First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved.

A very important and severe problem is  reliability and security. So far, it is still somehow not safe enough to completely rely on computers.

First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building.

Furthermore, as usual, we will organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wore a suit (for a man) or a skirt (for a woman). Furthermore, this party will be in your hotel as in the previous years. Finally, there are a lot of museums in our town. Therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fascinating.	First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building.

First of all the hotel Richard Brown has looked at is the Palace Hotel. It's located close to the main train station in our town. It is quite near the conference building. There will be extra buses to get there. The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entrance. The end-of-conference party will be a small dinner for all the students. You do not have to wear special clothes, just wear what you always wear. If you take your uniform with you it would be pleasant to leave it at the hotel and wear something else.

I received your letter and I'm happy to help you. We booked the Palace Hotel for your group. It's nice and quiet. I'm sure you'll be fine here. We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to get to the conference in a few minutes. When you go out of the hotel turn right and go straight on; turn right again at the first crossroads. At the end of this street you can see our college on your left. It's a green building. At the end-of-conference party there'll be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, there'll be some pictures of our college. You'll see all the generations who passed through here. Clothes aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people wear something different from the usual jeans.

Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is only 2 miles away from our college.

The reason we don't suggest you walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.

In my personal opinion one of the most important and useful things which has been invented is the car. Cars play a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time compared to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait at a bus stop in  cold and windy weather for a late bus, or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some track repairs. You can just jump into a car, tune your radio to your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination.

Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as a fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this.

From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and rely on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted some quality of life for my daughter and myself.

I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life. For example, I can travel to a lot of places in the U.K. Especially since I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire).

In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go past my village but the bus fares are very expensive for me. Apart from that it takes a long time to go somewhere.

The car has significantly affected my  life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than by using public transport. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music, as I brought some cassettes with me from Thailand. I took a  driving-theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a practical driving test very soon. I think I have to drive the car myself, so that I will know more about the advantages of using a car.	The car has largely affected my own life.

These days, we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented. In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how  easy a life we've got or, what is more, how  difficult our grandparents found it. How nasty we are! Let us try to appreciate their importance again.

As for me, the invention which is most important to me is the personal computer. I have been a full-time student in the university at home, and their classes all require us to have personal computers and use them at all times. When you take the class on computer programming, you will definitely need one and that holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistics on your computer  to do social research and some . My professor said, 'Go and get  with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'.	As for me, the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer.

I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without  thinking. That's the nature of human beings. But I think it's not only our fault but  evidence of how much they have integrated themselves into our life.

Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is the 'Palace Hotel'. Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference. Thirdly, the end-of-conference party will be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you can wear something quite casual.

We are nearly always surrounded by  'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on. In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire. These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out. They had to read, study and walk in the dark. Today, this kind of thing hardly ever happens! Well, unless there is something wrong with the power supply.	We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on.

I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family. While I was in the toilet, all the lights went off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in  complete darkness before. When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb can be, and I was sure I could never, ever live without one.

Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity had . How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work?

Thank god for those who created our electricity and  it into every appliance. Electricity is a clever invention.

I, personally, couldn't live without  electricity. It has already  and played a great role in my life. I watch the television and use the computer every day. Moreover, other facilities in my house, the telephone, air-conditioner, fridge, for example, they  all need  electricity. That is why it is very important to my life.

The invention of the car was a great point in history. From there on people were mobile and had the opportunity to travel wherever they wanted. Within of course the physical barriers. People now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home.	The invention of the car was a great point in history.

Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to have a cup of tea. She sat down and, what a surprise, she found a lottery ticket.

The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell at the end of the 19th century. Nobody realized how important and how widespread an invention it would be in the future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling  relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing.

On the first floor, they have a huge radio room, for sending and receiving  information from all over the world, because they have  small BBC buildings all over the world also; for Example, THAILAND, the United States of America, INDONESIA and CANADA.

The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference. I would suggest you walk along New Street, which is the one next to the river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel on your right-hand side. The hotel is just opposite  the City Hospital.

As you possibly already know, the end-of-conference party will take place in the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. To answer your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes. However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all.

Without any doubt the invention that has affected my own life the most is the car. Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not  only in a positive way, but in a negative way as well. Picture this: a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets. Can you imagine it? To be honest, I can't. Cars are part of our daily lives. Traffic jams make people irritable, and sometimes really upset and violent. But people use cars, anyway.	The invention without  doubt, that has affected my own life by far is the car.

Could you imagine it? To be honest, I can't. Cars are part of our daily lives. Traffic jams make people nervous,  sometimes really upset and violent. But, anyway, people use cars.
If we don't use them we suffer because of them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and  other four-wheel motor vehicles. Isn't that ironic? To go to the countryside and be able to breathe fresh, unpolluted air, I use my car, which, in my opinion, does not help to maintain a clean atmosphere at all.

On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with a virtual world which computers create. Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to  increasing  unemployment.	On the other hand there are some disadvantages.

What a big person  Einstein was, who invented light. He created another day after sunset. People use it to do anything they want to do.

The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tend to dislike  historical visits, would be the various activities.

Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such  simple and everyday things like a telephone, a car, a computer  only seem to be normal and everyday for us  as we use them every day.

These inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.	Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such a simple and  things like a telefone, a car, a computer so only seem to be normal and  for us (or we have got used) as we use them every day. Hundred years before people couldn't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer. They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared, but not every one beleives it is really so.
Some people say that many  important inventions in our life are not so good and useful as we have got used to thinking them. First of all they talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create,  and some other problems. But in my opinion if people's inventions have a place in our lives they are  then. I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you  to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (I am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through  choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. The electric lamp was an important invention a hundred years ago (at that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible for us to survive without  electric light. Because of shipbuilding developments people were able to make all those geographical discoveries, and   is an undeniable necessity in our life.

I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone  doesn't matter wherever you are (I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. An electric lamp was an important invention  hundred years before (but for that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life. Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries, and an  is  undenyable neccecerity in our life.
Because of everything I have said I am more likely to think that the benefits of  people's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages.	In case of all  said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel's inventions are much  the all their disadvantages.

Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop over for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea  how popular it would be one day. Its first application was  to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one can imagine life without it.	Who of you could imagine life without the telephone?

However, there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extremely important invention. This is electricity, invented by Edison. In my opinion, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most  machines, appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can only be operated with electricity, which makes people not do too much physical labour. What is more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity.	However, there is something  which  is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention.

I have booked a hotel not far  from our school. The hotel is called the Epsom Down Hotel. Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00.

When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then. They all know where the conference is and when.	I have booked a hotel not far off from our school.

For instance, when I want to contact   my friend, it's quite helpful  to use e-mail.

First of all, you mustn't panic. It's not a serious enough problem to get upset. You must be very happy because you have been offered two jobs.

The festival was excellent in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets at the normal price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.

In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with  proper price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.
However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars  who participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of attendees. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres in either the films or the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more  plays and films next year.

But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea'."
Above all, realistic stories teach me something about  life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging  everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up on taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him.

In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives.

Dear  Jane Clark,	Dear madame Jane Clark,
I am writing this letter in order to make some suggestions for the International Arts Festival that took place a while ago. I was there for two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year. I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world.

Well, here are some of my opinions and suggestions. First of all, I think there should be more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists from only six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world.

The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls which were too small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year. By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming  festival as the reaction of the people was excellent.

In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have  permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom. My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either.	In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class.

At home, there are fewer rules. My parents don't really like imposing rules in the house. But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back.

I would like to change the rule about not speaking in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish, but I guess, to learn, we should speak English all the time.

We are not allowed to talk during  lessons and we have to do our homework every day. Usually we don't have to wear school uniform, but there are schools in which there is such obligation. In most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty. If I could change anything, I would probably reduce the amount of homework.

The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classical music, which were fantastic. However,   some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for the audience, so a few people had to stand and watch the concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised.

At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommend it to other friends. That's how I am feeling about that.	Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket.

Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children.

But most teachers consult with their parents, so if they behave wrongly it is true that teachers call their parents.

Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small.

As you know, I'm not a secondary school student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On Saturday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there is a lot of drawing and painting, and some other subjects done by hand. We also learn how to design  interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons in the morning, till the afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all the class, for example near a lake, and there we paint  nature.

When I found the advertisement for the International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is  to hold an annual international arts festival in this place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world, jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance shows etc. The  thing that is worth remembering here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourists could  what they liked.

Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The  thing  is worth  here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could  what they like.
Although  I enjoyed it, there were still some things that needed to be improved. For example, there were some concert halls which were too small to hold so many people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience. In  addition, when you organize  next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films?	Although how I enjoyed it, there were still   needed to be improved.

You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This reminds me of what I experienced during my teenage years. In my country the children go to  secondary school when they are in the first year of being a teenager. You know, this age is the troublesome age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. They always annoy the schoolteacher and their parents. As a result of this, the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak to each other in  class. They have to finish homework within a limited time. They cannot   the teacher, girls are not allowed to wear make-up or wear any jewellery. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me a lot of  homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbade me to have a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home, many of my friends had the same experience.	You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter.

Now I'm a mother of two children. They are both in  school. Compared to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother to them and a friend to them. But at school, although I hope the teacher doesn't give students so much homework, and doesn't forbid the  of the students, there is nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad.

Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunately the school that I'm going to is like a military camp. The uniform we wear has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict, however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example, if you don't come to school for 10 days in a year, you fail that year.

Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alcohol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I play music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to.	Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course, which I don't do anyway.

Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concert halls too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were some interesting films but not enough. Perhaps you could possibly  some producers who come from other countries in order to show different cultures.	Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts halled too small.

To begin with the school rules, we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late for your lesson, you have to apologize  to your teacher.

I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there are a lot of people who go to see only one or two events, and by paying for the all-events ticket, they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expect to find interesting.

Here in Brazil the rules at school depend on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much stricter than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to wear the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams.	Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school.

The rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I study enough to . I think that my parents let me do what I want because they trust me. They know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not always easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them.	the rules at home are very different.

"The idea of making the festival ""international"" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch  artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls being too small. The plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I attended the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows were a sight for our sore eyes; they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas, not to mention their lifestyles, by talking to them. In addition to all that, the idea of joining in all the activities with one  priced ticket was excellent because it saved you from having to buy one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and other things, and also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect."

there were not very many films and plays. As a result of this there were not enough kinds of films. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased.

We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms or  of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during  classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winter we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school floors is not a nice sight, so we change our shoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to writing exams which are very often in Polish schools.	We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal.

Dear Ms Clark,	 Ms Clark,
First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can get to know artists who come from different countries. Unfortunately, in the last  the artists  came from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa.

In my opinion, one of the best things about the last Festival was that there were not only concerts there. I saw films and I played ping-pong. At the next  will there be more or less of that? More I hope. The thing that I liked much more than anything else was that I only had to buy one ticket for all the events, and it was not pricey.

It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you. I think you should have a kindergarten. In fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their children.

Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quiet and sit down. You must always pay attention because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, and you mustn't eat chewing gum or take a Walkman with you. In my home I can avoid those rules. My mum just doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but I must tell her beforehand. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the truth. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says.	Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite and sat .

Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money makes the world go round, so they always look for a job with a big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free time than waste it. In my opinion, the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities of earning some money but of course the young are not able to get a well-paid job, because they are not experienced and educated enough. They have to think about   jobs. Firstly, a good way to earn money is to help the old. They are often not able to do their shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and a permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are a good mathematician you can be a seller.	Nowadays everybody wants to earn money.

Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time. This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys.

Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of our parents have limited the talking time  to five minutes, threatening to cut off the  otherwise.

The best advantage of this job is the pay. It is very good considering how little time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home tutors are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and that means they take lessons after school, not in the daytime.

Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you. How are things going over there? It's quite difficult to talk about our school rules actually, but I'll try to help you somehow. Hope it will be interesting for you. By the way, are you allowed to smoke in the school? Our teachers don't let us smoke, of course, but you can always see some students smoking outside, so it's not that strict to be honest. We're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teachers.	Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you.

As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate in the lessons and also pass the exam in June 2000. In our class, we don't have a problem with students who dislike working, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to stay there for years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long.	As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon.

Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself and be polite with the teacher and the other schoolchildren. During the break , usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and . I mean as regards the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them (though not always) but also speaks with them.

"At home it is different. Each family has its own rules. As far as I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay up very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a clever child. So, usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules, like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your nose""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere."

I think there are some opportunities for earning money. I would say the simplest way is to give lessons to pupils, for example, in maths or English.

It was an excellent idea to have one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events. A lot of people could visit as many events as  they wanted.	It was a great idea to organize such  festival.

I was very surprised when I learned that the stars and artists were from only six countries. It was too few for this festival. It was a pity that the halls used for the classical concerts were too small. I like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sound of the music was terrible.

I have some suggestions for next year's festival. Firstly, it will be great if you invite more famous singers and bands. The second one is to include more musical films and plays. I would like to help you in your interesting work. I look forward to your answer.	I have some suggestion for next year's festival.

I want you to know what an extraordinary time I had with my friends at the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world for only that reasonably priced ticket we bought for the whole weekend. The festival was very well organised with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. In my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small. You have to consider booking a bigger one for  next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend.

In my house rules practically don't exist because I am 18 years old now so my parents' only wish is that I study for a university degree and be a good man. They only want to know where I am and when I go out and at what time I came home. At school it is completely different because the teachers don't forgive you anything. You have to be quiet and attentive in class if you don't want to be punished. I'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things. I wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some discipline to do the right things.

I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly, I want to congratulate you on organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of event. Secondly, I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it said so in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented. I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as an oven inside.	I went to your annual international arts festival.

One of the best is working in a big supermarket. Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring. Furthermore, department stores are always looking for students who would like to work.

However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. Also, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones.

To start with I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook, and they make us feel and think.

"As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction  as each masterpiece is unique in its own way regardless of  what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand our own life and the people around us better. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastical story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination."

I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea. I spent two nice days watching its events. I was there with my boyfriend. We have similar interests but we have different opinions. For me - the dance shows were absolutely wonderful. I like dancing and I like watching dance shows. The dancers wore nice clothes, and the music was very good. Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers. I prefer them to others. Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries. We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small. During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so they need more room. I like listening to  classical music in the big halls, too. My boyfriend was excited about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers. He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person. We had no time to watch all the plays and films. We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the events because we could change our plans during the event.

I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. First of all - we have to be on time. Our lessons start at 8 am and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear  school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most  students wear jeans and a sweater. We have to be quiet during  lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. This is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we get good marks at school they let us go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't compulsory. We aren't allowed to smoke or drink any alcohol.

Hello. How are you doing? I've also been thinking about rules at home with my friends. Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much. I really want to change this. However, I can go out whenever I want, even at  midnight. I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home.	Hello. How are you doing?

There are a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite an unusual rule in a Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home. I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secondly, boys are not allowed to have long hair. They have to cut their hair once a month. Girls can't have make-up on at school at all. I want to at least put lipstick on. I wish I could change this rule.	There is a lot of rules at my school.

What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, so I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask  my Mum or Dad about going out with my friend after  school. They wanted me to do my homework before going out to play. Also, I had to come back  home on time. It was very important for my parents. I didn't want to change anything. I was happy.

First of all, it is a great idea to have  this kind of festival. I enjoyed it so much. But, there are three things which I would like to tell you. Firstly, there were stars and artists from only six countries. I expected to see a variety of nationalities. Secondly, I actually liked the Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much. However, some concert halls were too small for the large number of people so we couldn't have a enough space. Thirdly, I would like  you to consider  having more plays and films next year. It would be nicer.	First of all, it is  great idea to have a this kind of festival. I enjoyed it so much. But, there are three things which I would like to tell you. Firstly.

Let me tell you some rules at school in my country. Actually, we have quite strict rules. When I was a student, I wasn't allowed to wear any fashionable clothes.  And we couldn't wear any colourful clothes and socks. Also our hairstyle was the same for everyone. It's really strict.	Let me tell you some rules at school in my country. Actually.

Two sisters, Alex and Daniela, were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking about what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found a present for their mother. Giving Christmas presents was a tradition not to be forgotten and there were only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk in this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister.

After forty minutes, the weather became very bad. It was such a pain to walk in the snow. However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold.

Unfortunately, Daniela fainted. She was so cold that she couldn't move her legs. Alex began to cry and to pray and when Daniela was about to die an angel appeared.

I was impressed with the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different cultures and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days at the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for a student too.

Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far more than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concentration on my studies and I spent the money on entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old.

Secondly, I made a brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computers at that time. Also I was leader of the computer-user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was a part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer work. I could earn money, and I also got a career.

Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard, but I think that was an easy way to make money. I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time. So the loss was bigger than the profit.	Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday. It was also hard and difficult, but I think that was  easy way to make money.

In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that, in school, we have lots of rules, especially in  class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toilet during  lessons. We have to go there in the break. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strict. I don't like it. If I could, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can succeed at once. We should give them a second chance to succeed.

When I found out there was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small so that I felt very uncomfortable.

As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important ones were concerning wearing  suitable clothes, arriving on time and getting on with every teacher and authority figure.

At home it is the other way round. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as invite friends over, watch TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to help out with the household chores and meals.

I must say that our school rules are quite different to yours. First of all we have to stand up when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you miss a lesson, that could cause a problem for you. I think it depends on the school. Private schools have a more relaxed atmosphere than the state schools. They don't have strict rules and students can take extra lessons.	I must say that our school rules are quite different than yours.

On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviour is punished.

I have a relaxed family and we share all the housework. My father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I  tidy up! But in many families, women do more than men. I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together.	I have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks.

The festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists from only six counties they could be invited  from all over the world.

Although your advertisement said there would be stars and artists from around the world, I was able to see artists from only six countries.

Dear Tim, I'm glad to have your letter back so soon. Do you want to know about our country's rules? I think your country and our country's rules are the same. First, in school, we are not allowed to run. This is very important, because many accidents happen because of running. When we need to go upstairs, you have to keep left and when you have to go downstairs, you need to keep left as well. You have to do your homework and do your best at what you're asked to do. You can't go to the toilet during the class, because you are interrupting the other students' study and there are more.. like when the class starts you have to keep quiet and you can't say anything while the teacher speaks. Second, at home we all have different rules. Some families have rules that you have to  spoons and dishes everyday. I think the main rule is when you can play computer games, because they love computer games. Tell me about English rules. I'm curious about it.  best wishes from  	Dear Tim, I'm glad to have your letter back  soon. Do you want to know about our country's rules? I think your country and our country's rules are the same.

On the other hand there are other rules which annoy us like the ones  clothing. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and we feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in what we wear. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us.

As you told me in your last letter, you were talking about rules in your class and you wanted to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home.

We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good, because mum and dad are great but there's one main rule: I must tell them where I am going and what time I'll come back.

First of all, it would be better if there were more famous people of various nationalities, because most of them were from English-speaking countries this year. In addition, larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars. Moreover, personally, I hope that the number of plays and films will increase. I think they are the  'arts' in real life.

Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. It allowed people to enjoy their weekend, relax , and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening their knowledge. In addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10. This was excellent. It meant people only spent , and then they could watch all the events at the weekend.

Moreover, the stars and artists were from only six countries.

At school, the most horrible one is about the school uniform. I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashionable clothes, colourful shoes or colourful socks. Also we can't change our hair colour and have to keep our hair length above our eyebrows. Next, we're not allowed to get driver's licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we're students. We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs. If possible, I want to change all of them.	At school, the most horrible one is  school uniform.

However, at home I'm quite free. I just can't go out after 9 o'clock at night and I'm not allowed to play computer games for over two hours. These rules are not so strict that I can't stand them. I don't think I want to change them.	However, at home I'm quite free. Just I can't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and I'm not allowed to play computer games  over two hours.

I am writing to suggest some ideas for the International Arts Festival next year. I have just been there and thought of some improvements which could make the festival better.	I am writing to suggest some idea for the International Art Festival next year. I have just been there and noticed some points which could make the festival better.
First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but only from six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some of the concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for all the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing the dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a one-day ticket or a reasonably priced ticket for every event.	First of all, the festival was a great idea.

Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of their skirts  5 cm below their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't interfere with studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning!	Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school.

In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand . I'm not allowed to go out late at night. I want to go dancing sometimes. You're allowed to do that, aren't you? That's wonderful! I'm really jealous of you!	In my house, I'm allowed to do anything unless it bothers somebody. But there's one thing I can't stand up.

"In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favourite classical , ""La Moldava"" by Smetana.

In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict. Nobody should be late in the morning because it is important to respect your classmates' and teachers' effort  to get up early. Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson. I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is  bad manners. There isn't any kind of punishment for people who do these things.

My parents are very good. The most important thing for my parents is that I don't tell them lies.

"Firstly I want to congratulate you on the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there were only stars from six major countries. I suggest you increase this number for  next year. In this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I want to point out is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't get into the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? The last thing that I will say is ""one reasonably-priced weekend ticket""  was a very good idea. I hope you will do the same thing next year."	"Firstly I want to congratualate you for the festival.

I have a surprise for you. I am coming to England this summer. Maybe we can meet there... You asked some questions about the rules in school and homes. Let me answer these questions. In schools we aren't allowed to speak in class. Also we must go to school in our uniforms. However we are allowed to eat and drink during the breaks. We must be kind to our friends and teachers all the time. We mustn't forget the books for the classes. These are the rules in school. In our home there are some rules too! I must be at home by 11pm. I am not allowed to listen to loud music at home. I must be kind to my brother and my parents. When  guests come to our home, I must be clean. Other things are allowed to me. I want to change the school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want. The other rules are O.K. I want to hear some rules from you. Next time write the letter quickly! I don't want to wait another 2 months.	I have a suprise for you. I will  to  this summer. May be we can meet there...

If the weather is hot then we don't have to wear underwear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies. There will be two functions for summer clothes that we don't need to wear clothes . For example, T-shirts for women will include a bra: easy to take it out when you wash it, and it is very simple and comfortable. What about short pants? You don't have to wear knickers. We can just put some thin pads in there. We can't feel it and easy to remove and just  wash it. Simplest is the best in summer!

When it's very cold in winter, we just wear light clothes , in our style.

I went to the Circle Theatre to watch the 'Over the rainbow' musical show, recently. I was truly disappointed by it. My expectations were high after I'd read your leaflet in which it was advertised as 'London's newest and best musical show'. Now, I can assure you it wasn't. Firstly, it was Danny Brook who was supposed to star. The substitute was far worse. Secondly, I had to wait forty-five minutes before the show finally began. Another unkept promise was the discounts. There weren't any! Lastly, when I got hungry after the delay it appeared that the theatre restaurant was closed. You can believe me it wasn't 'my perfect evening out' and I have no other choice than to ask you to give me my money back. I paid for something I didn't get so it is obvious that I want my money back. I got the £15 ticket.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days, the whole school knew. When Paul entered the school gate, other children began to tease him and laugh. Paul couldn't stand it. He ran out quickly, leaving everyone behind. He felt very ashamed and didn't know what to do. Normally, he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him. They were no longer friends. 'How could he,' Paul thought 'Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me'. As he was sitting there, he heard someone walking towards him. He turned around and saw... Jean. 'What are you doing here? Why aren't you at school?' she asked. Paul was  paralyzed. He couldn't reply. 'I heard what you've said about me', she said, I think it's sweet'. Paul couldn't believe his ears. While he was thinking how to reply, Jean took his hand and led him to the school. When they entered everyone became silent. All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat wasn't that bad at all.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days the whole school knew.

Secondly, I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour later and in addition to this anyone didn't . Moreover I would like to ask why Danny Brook, which is my favourite actor, didn't play in the show. Furthermore I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I wish I had known it two days ago... On 15th June we were at the birthday party. Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him. I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together, but it wasn't such a good idea.

I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way. Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin. It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was staring at us. Yesterday, I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony. I really regret that I was so foolish.

Dear Manager	Mr. Manager:
I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your musical show I had a very bad time.	I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your Musical show I had a very bad time.
Firstly when I went to the show it was written that the start time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight. I had waited for forty-five minutes. Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show. It was the first time I had been  to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too. Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered.

It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too. Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered.
And  lastly that was the worst night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they wouldn't give me it so I had an argument with the people who worked there but I couldn't get my money back.	And as last that was the worse night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they wouldn't give  it so I had an argument with the people Who worked their but I couldn't get my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school someone came up to me and I noticed that it was Pat. She saw me as I was smoking so that wasn't going to be very good. She said that she wouldn't tell  anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I was always with her every minute, every second. But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat in front of our house door talking to my dad. I just knew I shouldn't have trusted  her but as I went in the house my dad asked  to stay for a meal. I was in  shock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry with me? After a while we sat down for dinner and Pat just told my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry. I couldn't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and that she can't keep any secrets.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. First, we couldn't get a discount, although you mention it in your advertisement. And the only tickets left were  £20. Then the show began 45 minutes later than stated. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. We are used to eating at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good  value but also for it's original decor.	Anyway we had a very disappointing evening.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets. The following story will prove it. I left the office at six o'clock. I was free as the air. My husband was doing a course all  week in Berne.

I drove to Ouchy where I had a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't a swimming costume. I knew a good place. I parked the car and waited ten minutes. As I had planned, the place was deserted. I took my clothes off and swam for twenty minutes in the lake. Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing. I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come across anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too.	I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink.

Unfortunately a police car drove by and the policeman saw me standing there nude. They drove me to their office after having given me a shirt. There I called Pat who picked me up. I felt so miserable that Pat laughed to see me. Of course she told everything to my husband. If only Pat could keep secrets!

Firstly, you spoke about two actors, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad. So I was really surprised. In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late. It was boring for everybody. How could we appreciate the show properly.

Moreover, in your advert you wrote that there were discounts available but it was not the case. No discounts were available. Then you invited people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there were no staff to welcome  people. You offered something you could not possibly provide.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started . I thought she was a really good friend but I made a mistake. She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with. She didn't tell me  but when I came to the class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well. I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her to the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her the whole story. She said that I had to be strong and not care about them. So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me. Then all the girls became jealous and stopped laughing.

I went to your theatre last Saturday, at about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts. But a clerk said that the time for discounts had ended. I did not care about the money and I rushed into the theatre and then took a seat with some food. I was waiting for the show that was supposed to start at 7.30 p.m. But it started at 8.15. I felt nervous. When I saw an actor, he was a different actor. I was very upset and disappointed.	I went to your theatre last saturday,  about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts.

I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisement that there were some discounts available. I asked about it but the answer I received was that there weren't any kind of discounts. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at that moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant idea to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed!

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Over the last five years, she has caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody. This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her, their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential. Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested , and decided to lead her own enquiry into this case. Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story seemed very strange. Despite Katie's warning, Pat achieved her purpose by carefully questioning her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to steal this camera or else he would be hurt. Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the the help of adults. Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway... She got the two criminals convicted, and recovered the calm  within the school. It was the first time she had saved someone by telling a secret, and she realized she had made a good choice.

Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, as the  said they gave discounts to people who worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put it in the paper then?

There were a couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made a fool of myself by arriving late and had to suffer all those people staring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts were not available but on the notice board it said that they were available. After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day.	There were  couple of things I noted down during the show.

"We are both very keen on musicals. We've already seen ""Cats"", the ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""les Miserables"", ""Grease"", and so many others. When we saw your leaflet that mentioned ""London's newest and best musical show"", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we immediately bought the tickets. On the  evening, people stood at the entrance who were shouting at you because there weren't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble finding our seats, but we found it very annoying to wait 45 minutes before the show started and more than that your famous actors definitely weren't Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygiene problems. I can say now that ""It wasn't my perfect evening out"" and I now request some money back for all these annoyances."	"We are both very keen on musical shows.

On the waiting evening, at the entrance stood people, who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found  very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show  and more  that your famous actors weren't  Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles. I can say now that ""It wasn't my perfect evening out"" and I request now some money back for all these disagreements."
In my opinion, I think that people will not wear clothes anymore, just be natural, being nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find their authenticity again.

"Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical  ""Over The Rainbow"", which was performed at your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was another actor instead of him, which was a great disappointment to me. Secondly, as for the times of the performance, instead of 19.30 it  started at 20:15, which meant being stranded at the theatre for such a long time. In addition, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. However, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you for a full refund or at least some of my money back.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. What is more, every time I trusted her with my secrets, she always let me down.

At home, for example, my alarm is no longer a deafening sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio programme, set to start at seven o'clock.

Dear Sir: I am writing this letter to you because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I became very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It was supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because  the advertisement for the show said that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore,  the advertisement said that the theatre restaurant was open but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the the restaurant chef was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, otherwise, I will have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Furthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every  machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.
On the other hand, despite the fact that technology makes things easier in our daily life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get  jobs because they are not needed they fall into poverty, criminal activities, become isolated and have no chance of getting a good education. This is the most terrible disadvantage technology has.

Dear Sir, I would like to tell you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage. As I had a whole week's holiday I decided to spend it in London. At first I thought I would just do a bit of sightseeing all around the city. But when one night I saw your advertisement I decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical . No sooner had I seen who the starring actor was than I couldn't believe it. Danny Brook was one of my best friends while I was at University. But as the show began, I realised that the actor was someone different, his name was Tim Paradise. If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened, but I had to wait till quarter past eight  to watch the show, instead of it beginning at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement.

One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what  could be the final answer sheet to the exam on the top of his desk. , when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers into my notebook. I couldn't believe it. This would be the easiest exam I would do. As I went out of the office I found Pat, my best friend, walking down the corridor. As she was also doing the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she mustn't talk about it to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my classmates were at the front door of my house asking me if I had the answers to the exam.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is my best friend. We spent all our childhood together, usually driving our parents mad. As we grew up, we were getting closer and closer, sharing all our love stories and even more. I'm certain that our friendship is stronger than other people's. But I do have a problem with her. Pat isn't good at keeping secrets. Even worse, she is not able to keep anything to herself. For instance, I was organizing a party for my sister's birthday, asking all her. friends to keep their mouths closed. They all did except one: Pat. Last year, Pat and I were driving back home and unfortunately, driving too fast, I drove through the front gate. I was wondering how to tell my parents and I asked Pat if she could keep it secret till I found the way to tell them. Of course, the following day all my family had heard  my odd story. In conclusion to this, why do I still get on with her. It's the fact I love her as much as my sister and I know that she can change  if she must because, last week, she organized a huge party for me, without telling me.

The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I decided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show. This was especially due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor. I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor. The 'theatre' did not even apologize for this change. To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have  (it started at 20:15 instead of 19:30). Despite my being a student and the advertisement saying that discounts were available, I was refused  a half-price ticket, and the explanation 'why' wasn't sufficient. I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which, according to the advertisement, ought to have been open at that time. Unfortunately it was not, which made me even angrier. There was no information about why it was closed and if it would be open at all.

The advertisement says 'your perfect evening out'. However, it was the worst evening I have had in London. I would like you to give me my money back.	The advertisement say 'your perfect evening out', however it was the worst evening I have had in London. I would like you give me my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday. However, on Friday almost half of my class knew what was going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I passed the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving centre for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I hoped that nobody was watching me. Unfortunately, Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The instructor opened the car door and asked me to sit in the driver's seat. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very often crossing the white line on the road. I looked in the mirror and I saw how my friends were laughing. It made me crazy. I started doing stupid things: turning right instead of left and so on.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

The next day, I decided that I didn't want to go to school any more. I was afraid that everybody would comment on my first lesson. I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. ,  things weren't so bad.

First of all, the show started 45 minutes late. We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason for the delay and apologise about it.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a very pretty and kind girl, but she had this bad habit. This was her only fault. She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her. That was why she decided to change her behaviour. She was given a chance: if she was able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would start trusting her. The secret was about a surprise party for her best friend's birthday. As soon as the arrangements for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her best friend. But, as the days went by, she was surprised because she realized she was getting used to not telling secrets anymore. The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret. All her friends were amazed at how she had  changed and started trusting her at once.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

The story began in 1989 in New York. Mallory and his partner, Pat, had thought up the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank. However, the only way to get into the building was at the top of the building. Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building. The alarm was situated at the top. So they could take their time, rather than going in through the front door. As soon as Mallory stole the diamond, he ran away. Unfortunately the guard saw him.

I had to wait ten days before the lottery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won. But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone.

But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone.
But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and I found out that I had many unsuspected friends... Not long after, they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant. Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me.

Finally the end of the week came and I went to the lottery office to find out the amount I had won. I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs because a lot of people had had five numbers like me. SO I told my friend Pat how much I had won and the following day at school everybody was just the same as they ever were with me...

First of all, you advertised a cast including Danny Brook, but he wasn't there! Secondly, the show should start at 19.30, and in fact it started 45 minutes late.

Over the centuries man's clothes have been changing and even developing in some ways. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose.

I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another, horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to get a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was no discount either for her  or anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because he likes to tease people. So, it was last summer, we were on a short trip with our class to an adventure park. We had a lot of fun. Until we came to a big cave, where you could walk through. It was quite scary for me, but I said to myself, come on you can do it. I walked in first with Pat and two of my friends. But suddenly, there were only Pat and me left. We lost the others. So I tried not to get in a panic, but had no chance. I was so worried I would not find the way out that I started to scream and cry. First, Pat started to laugh, but as he realized that I didn't stop crying, he comforted me until I calmed down. And after a while we found the way out. I asked him not to tell anybody that I cried. He said, 'Sure, no problem'. But next day, back in the classroom, some of the students looked at me and started to laugh. After that it was all clear, Pat and secrets.

"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I knew that he's a very talkative person, but it was necessary because I wanted him to be the main organiser of that birthday party for . It started a week before that day. Pat found a great place for the party called ""Blue Box"". I made  beautiful invitations  for all of Agatha's friends with a note: ""Do not tell Agatha about this. This is a surprise party for her. Please keep the secret!"" Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made the perfect decorations with balloons and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was breathtaking. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gathered in the disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha, who was expected at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so exciting!!! We turned off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard ""What the hell is going on?!!"" She entered the room, and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR! She was so touched that we started to cry. Anyway the disco was great, . We had fun until 5 o'clock! Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever receive!"

I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed with that evening. You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my favourite, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of. In the advertisement for the show, you said it would begin at 19.30. Actually it was delayed 45 minutes. The discounts on tickets that you mentioned did not exist. It made things worse that our visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of a lack of customers, was cancelled. Really, what a letdown!

However, all my expectations failed to come true. First of all, I found that no discounts on tickets were available although you mentioned them in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the start they announced that Danny Brook would not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor.

Among the greatest inventions of man I come across daily are the telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of the day I may contact any person in any part of the world over the phone. It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousands of kilometres away from me. The computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get  access to  informational sources through the Internet, to do shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly. The automobile saves me time when I'm travelling.	Among the greatest inventions of man I came accross dayly are  telephone, computer and automobile.

Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor Danny Brook. That left me so disappointed. Secondly, I thought the show would start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. It caused me to miss the train and I went back to the hotel when it was nearly  midnight. Another problem is I thought that  discounts were available. However, there wasn't any discount. Additionally, the advertisement said I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show. When I arrived, it was closed. It is so annoying that everything was changed without any notice.

Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate. The class had organized a secret party for our friend Nick who was leaving the school in 2 more weeks. It all started when Pat, Nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. Most of the class disagreed with that because the Pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him that his house was like a box. Pat got very angry and sad. Pat, affected by this situation, told Nick all about the situation and the class secret. At first Nick got angry but then he forgave him because they were friends and each of them could trust in the other. Nick told the situation to the class and offered his house for the party, because it was very big, with large gardens and a big swimming pool. The day of the party everyone had fun, especially Pat who to start with was sad.	Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate.

Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK performing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him on that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed until 20:15.

Maybe you could explain to me what the problems were. By problems I mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts available? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were different actors to those advertised who were not very good at acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed.

Unfortunately, modern technology has made  life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opportunity to just get into a car and drive  wherever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go onto the Internet to get any information you need. Production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for the workers anymore. Everything is controlled and produced by machines. This is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing their jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they watch TV or play or work on the Computer and don't see each other anymore because they don't have to. You never get bored.

One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor, announced in the ad to be Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, after forty-five minutes' delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The ad also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason!

We can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than the life our parents lived, thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of. The Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our lives will be completely different in forty years. And, since all these new things only make our lives easier, technology is welcome.

As I thought your advertisement was interesting, I went there but it was not as good as it should be. First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook as you wrote. Secondly, it ought to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:30. According to the advertisement,  discounts would be available. In fact, I had to pay the full price, which cost me £15. After the show I intended to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because, though you knew that the show started late,  the restaurant had closed before the show finished.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But when I came to this school a few months ago I didn't know this. We are in the same maths set so I met him rather soon. He was one of the first people who I got to know. After a few days he was already my best friend. Everything was going perfectly before last month when I met a girl from the other school. Her name was Marine. I saw her as a perfect girl with whom I had fallen in love . So one day she invited  me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illegal. I had decided to go. So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climbed out of the window. Unfortunately for me Pat at the time was going to the toilet and saw me. So I asked him to keep it a secret. I came back at 6 o'clock in the morning and went to sleep again. Next day my best friend went to the headmaster and told him about me so he put me on suspension.

First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation being given. Secondly, although the show started at 20:15, your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and I was not able to eat dinner. I had planned to have dinner there after the show. What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID. Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant event during my holiday in London.

It was just an ordinary day. Somehow I felt like sharing my secret with her and told her that the new pop singer who was very popular among girls was my cousin.

He is just sweet-looking. The next day, I went to school as usual and was agog at the large number of girls waiting for me around my locker. They all seemed to want to be my best friend, and only Pat seemed to be happy to be my best friend.	It was just an usual day.

It is certainly true that  modern technology has been changing our life a lot  these days. But how does it affect  my daily life?

Sometimes I even play some games on it.  study or work, I use the Internet, which is the easiest way to get information from all around the world.

Hello. I'm Robert and I'm writing  an article about clothes in the future. In my opinion, in a hundred  years we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays. What will change with clothes will be how comfortable they are and the way they protect us and our bodies from temperature and physical attacks. I think they will cool us in the summer and make us warmer in the winter. Clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free. Wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater at high pressure, and we'll have freedom of movement. Technology will play a part in clothes' development, scientists will find a way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable, so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes. I hope I win the trip!	Hello. I'm Robert and I'm writting for the article about clothes in the future.

From my point of view, almost all humans would like to be more and more attractive, so we always think about it. As a result, clothes are the easiest way to be more attractive. In addition to this, anyone will agree with me that clothes are the best invention ever. Furthermore, it's one of the best way to make money.
Anyway, don't you think that, nowadays, fashionable clothes are quite similar to what they were 20 years ago? It's evident that whatever we wear looks like clothes, and I think we should stop being so stupid. We can't wear peculiar clothes like in science fiction films. I bet you that in 100 years, humans will be wearing exactly the same clothes as today, because we love the , which is wonderful. The last survey about fashion showed that people feel really comfortable with  now!	Anyway, don't you think that nowadays, fashionable clothes is quite similar than  20 years ago?

"I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed. I'm not from here (this city), so I wanted to know everything about it: its culture, history and the famous musicals. Everything was perfect and beautiful till yesterday. Yesterday I wanted to go to the theatre to see a musical . I went to the theatre to see  what time the show was, 19.30. That was OK so I bought a ticket. At that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that meant that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 minutes; the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, there was a different actor. At that moment I was really angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad hygiene and food. That was too much.

First of all, I think we have grown up with  technology. It's difficult for us to recognise the changes in our lives, but we can think about them. How has it changed my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life more comfortable. Now I only need to push a button, and things or machines work on their own. Homework is easier to do with the computer than with a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology goes so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it makes us think more about our future jobs. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things work and that scares me. I will be useless, because a machine will do all the work.	First of all I think we have grown  with the technology. It's difficult for us to realize the changes in our , but we can think about it.

"On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical ""Over the Rainbow"" at the ""Circle Theatre"". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but, when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the reasons why I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't appear! So when the miserable musical came to its end, we were happy to leave the theatre auditorium, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurants were open anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just found a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a small sign on a door: ""Sorry, we are closed for renovations""! We thought it  was a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change anything. I would prefer to get my money back, instead of getting a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again!"	"On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine.

How much effort and time it took about two decades ago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can even make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices have made our life easier as old fridges had to be defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if you have forgotten to close the door! The modern cooker will turn itself off if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us.

"The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show ""Over the Rainbow,"" which I attended  a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset as when I realized that the famous actor I expected, Danny Brook, would not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was quite mediocre.

To begin with, never have I been so upset  when I realized that the  expected famous actor Danny Brook, did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was, quite mediocre.

It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what clothes will be like 100 years from now. With no doubt, the influence of modern technology will be great. In future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable. We can see the progress in  fashion even now. It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year  2050.

On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computers or telephones I could have less opportunities to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think the car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit.	On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known. She had told him about her relationship with her boyfriend. Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John loved each other so much that it wouldn't be surprising to find that they had had sex . The point here is that Caroline chose the worst friend to tell this to. She was also concerned about being pregnant, but she was afraid to tell John about it. So she decided to ask Pat what to do. When she finally told him, Pat reacted in a very bad way and told John immediately. He couldn't believe what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose. Pat's father had to pay for a very expensive operation. But like every story this has a happy ending. John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her imagination. And Pat understood that .	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

It is rare that schools  don't have a multimedia centre with many computers for the students to use. But this is good and bad at the same time. Good because you can have access to a lot of information, and it is bad because the computers are doing  people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who has the certain knowledge that  computers will not take the place of  teachers? It is interesting to start to think about this point.

The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show. However, I bought a £20 ticket mostly because I saw his name in the advertisement. Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although it was supposed to start at 19:30. Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening, and I think you should know that tickets were sold without any discounts.	The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show.

It seems to me that all these failures were your fault, because you were responsible for the organisation of the show.

In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. By a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio, or a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play games or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school.	In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without.

For the attention of the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were  were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing in his performance. In addition, the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we would be able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because the Chef who runs the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts on the tickets would be available, but they were not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization running the theatre gave me my money back. yours sincerely,	For the attention to the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented.

What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear on the stage at all. An understudy took his place. We felt totally disappointed and cheated.

Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put to practical use, our living conditions are becoming more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around  the house, it is easy to find things like  a microwave oven, TV set, computer etc. All these items of equipment are  applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose a train, car or even a plane as your means of transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take you several years to reach your destination.	Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways.

I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totally different. In my opinion the world  itself will be different in temperature as a result of global warming, also people will become  nicer, less <unknown /> this will take place, so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with  colours like dark green or grey. They will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable. Also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and Green peace will be very strong , much stronger and more powerful than it is now. So  we can imagine the Future Fashion might be pleasant or unpleasant for different people. The styles will be more or less the same as each other and everyone will be satisfied with them .

"I had a very disappointing evening. First, Danny Brook didn't appear in ""Over the rainbow"", his part was played by Danny De Vito. Also, the play started forty-five minutes later than the time announced. I can understand that a play can start fifteen minutes late, but not forty-five. Second, my wife and I paid £20 for the tickets and we asked for discounts. The receptionist who gave me the tickets told me that no discounts were available that night. After a boring play, I decided to go to the theatre restaurant, but peculiarly it was closed. I decided to go home and make some sandwiches.

An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can find more information than I can in a newspaper, and also information from all around the world, which I could never possibly access without the Internet. But, it is not only news or information. You can communicate with people in places where you would never  imagine going to because it would be too expensive. An example could be the popular chat rooms, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like using the keyboard to say something or to communicate, you can use video conferencing, a system which lets you  talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also there is the potential to download things to your PC like software, pictures and, also, music. The modern technologies mean I am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a , I can carry this music  everywhere.	An example could be the Internet.

Also computers and mobile phones have evolved thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we would probably still be in  ancient times. Who wants to return to  ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TVs, no phones, no PCs.. I'm afraid that the people in  ancient times lived although they didn't have any of these things, but me and everyone in these times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like to return to this life. Also, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that they are  expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down it  is because something new is at available to sell. It is like a  circle.	Also computers and mobile phones had evolutioned thanks to modern technologies.

I am writing to complain about the musical show, which I have seen in The Circle Theatre on 6th June.

The first problem was the price of tickets. I expected to buy a ticket cheaply but no discounts were available. Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late. I found the theatre rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row. Although I got a bit annoyed, I tried to have a good time.	The first problem was the price of tickets.

However, something wrong occurred again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brochure, did not play a part in the show. And I was really disappointed with the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show, but it was closed because it was being refurbished .

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So the surprise we prepared for  Leon's birthday had failed. However, we'd started to plan  for it  one month before.

We would pretend to have bought a dog for him. Leon hates dogs, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognise. And I found one. I had a friend who had just got a little dog. But he was  Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

First of all, my cousin, who lives there, had had many problems with the tickets. The line-up was changed and that was the worst surprise I could have had.

I arrived there on time, 19:15, in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15. What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected.

Dear sir, I'm writing to express my displeasure about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, Danny Brook should have been there, starring in all the scenes. Instead, you changed the actor without any warning, so I didn't see my favourite Danny Brook, which was a  total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't match him at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't get a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised in the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I should have a right to one. On top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being repaired, so I couldn't have my dinner either!

We live in the age of personal computers, of the Internet, of the mobile phone, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them. It's already four years since I bought my first cellular phone (since then I have changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am. When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friends and to my family than before.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life; the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her!

I moved away that year,  to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times.

However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having,  my parents getting a divorce.
When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day, to move to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers .

However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she had heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do with anyone. Ever since, she has had my trust and I have told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and, not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.

I'm writing to complain about the show, that I have recently attended to at your theatre. During my visit there occurred some problems, that made my evening completely disappointing.
Firstly, when I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. The play not only started 45 minutes after it was planned, but when the actors eventually appeared on the stage, I also saw that Danny Brook had been replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information being given about the reason for its closure.

In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes. What is more, the ground will be so hot that walking will only be possible in huge shoes, which will be massive, but not heavy at all. Another effect of the scorching weather could be that people won't be allowed to go out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials that aren't known yet.

I am from Brazil and I recently had a holiday in London. During my stay I read an advertisement for a musical show being put on at The Circle Theatre.

In the advertisement, it said that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was  disappointing.

First of all, there were  different actors. I was disappointed. The other point is that the organization was very bad. For example, it was said the show started at 19.30 but it started at 20:15.

In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans change to be more free from social rules, I think that their dress will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society changes to become stricter and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of  society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule . Perhaps the style of their dress will indicate their position in society too.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell her something, eventually everyone knows about it. But this time it was something more important than any other time.

I'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by Circle Theatre last Tuesday. The fact is it was quite different from the one I had expected to see. First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the flyer. I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed.

I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too. Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even though I had read on the flyer that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger. I suggest you should solve these problems quickly. If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was my best friend for several years as a child. But I haven't seen her since we were 10 years old. When were nine years old and were in third grade we had a 'House' where we used to play all afternoon. In fact it wasn't a real house, it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house. But we used to call it 'Our House'. It was a secret place and we had promised each other not to tell anybody about it. Usually we were cooking flower soup, and swapping secrets.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

In my opinion, clothes will be a lot different in 100 years' time.

I received quite a lot of money and I left home. For one week I really was travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone. Now I don't think that it was a good idea. Sometimes I had to sleep on  railway stations or under  bridges. After one month, I went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun I had with my friends - I don't know why I was such a liar. My parents believed my story until my younger brother Pat told them the truth. Now my parents don't believe my story. But I think this was a good lesson for me and I don't lie any more.

Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in high school and perhaps I had found him  here!

"Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I work as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I spent the whole of last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"" would be (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end to our stay in your city. But from the beginning we had a lot of problems. Despite  being actors we had to pay for a full-price ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the ticket desk was very impolite. However, we decided to go to the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our intention was to give him a surprise. You can imagine what our faces were like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay  till the end of the show and to have dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing time but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can see it was not our ""perfect evening out"" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is  hard work but I have to ask you for the money for the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes in the advertisement, before the start of the show. I am waiting for your answer,"	"Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre.

As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages.
The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this is sometimes an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job more easily, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. Using the computer has become  second nature.	The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer.

It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays. How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, as always, just a few weeks. Everything that is in fashion passes away in a couple of months and has to be created again.	It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays.

How has modern technology changed my daily life? Fifty years ago people didn't even think that after 2000 years they would have another life.

First of all, now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the Internet. Second, modern technology helps me in the kitchen.

"Modern technology has changed my life in many different ways: But this ""modern technology"" has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand we have the advantages;  new technology allows you to do many things like flying, seeing in the dark, or it can even save your life when you are almost dead. But on the other hand we have the disadvantages. Technology makes your life easier but for how long? For example, the car was developed through  modern technology. It makes your life easier but also more ""dangerous"". Why? Because too many cars means too much CO2 in the air. And everyone knows that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kinds of animals.

One of the essential developments has been in our means of transportation. The invention of cars, planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation has enabled us to go from one place to another in no time. This enables us to save a great deal of time and effort. Quite recently, in my country electric bicycles have been invented. This, compared to the traditional bicycle, is less physically demanding and less time-consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination quickly with hardly any effort at all. This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less.	One of the essential  is  the form of transportation.

This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less.
Another significant technological development is the invention of electrical appliances. There are many indispensable electrical appliances, such as television, radio, fax machines, and microwaves. What changed my life most are portal computers. They are particularly useful for someone like me who often travels. Before I used computers , it took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and look up  information. With a computer, however, all this is done in a matter of seconds. This again enables people to save time.	Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances.

I'm sorry to be writing to you about such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you advertised: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased to be seeing Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the stage! By the way, what really upset me was the starting time. According to your advertisement it started at 19:30, and what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost, which was from £10 to £20, but despite what I thought I had to pay £20 without any other options. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visiting the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me.

As I see it, the Old Man and the Sea is a really exciting book. It describes a challenge, the challenge of life. The main character is the old man who has to fight against the sea to stay alive. It could be his last adventure. This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish for something good. By surprise he comes across the biggest fish he has ever seen, a beautiful marlin. The man keeps constantly in contact with it. They are going to be one thing linked together. They're fighting for the same reason with the same strength, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish. I think they're really brothers, they feel the same pain and fear during the battle.

When I read this book, I was fascinated by the willpower of the old fisherman. This willpower is so amazing, he has all the elements against him. His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance of meeting anyone who could help him.

I think these are the reasons for his willpower. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself.

We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly from the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay £20 a seat.

The worst was to come. The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character. But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really needs singing lessons).	The worst was to come.

The first thing Pat did was to tell our young sister the secret. And, less than five minutes later, our mother knew the whole thing. Her reaction was not the one we were expecting. Obviously she was not surprised, but she was certainly angry. Really angry!! She thought it was a stupid idea, and also an expensive one. According to her, this car would have been useless. She suspected our father wanted to please himself.	The first thing Pat did was to tell our young sister the secret. And, less than five minutes later, our mother knew the whole thing.

First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people there came to see him. However, the man who took his place gave a good performance, we enjoyed listening to him because his voice was amazing.	First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing.

The time was not respected: the show began 45 minutes late. The children could not stand waiting outside in the cold.

The ways we travel are improving a lot at present. Cars are really useful and a lot faster than walking or cycling. But cars create pollution: for example the greenhouse effect.

Technology also improved  communications with the phone of course and also with the Internet. Every evening when I come back home I go on the Internet. I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for information I need for my studies.

It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, there was a different, unknown actor in that.

I think young people  which make them look like they are almost naked even in winter. I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick.

I am writing to you about your production: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It was another actor who played very badly. Secondly, the musical should start at 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing happened for such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement that are not true?

I had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change  clothes and  fashion so much again.

First of all, I have to say that the advertisement promised something totally different from what I saw there.

Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone, with the development of satellite communication, seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life?

Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite  seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life?
As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influences me is through my work: the Internet has become such an incredible tool, I can  research into everything I want, find information for lectures, for example, or exercises. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge.

Nevertheless, new technology has made me  more lazy. I spend a lot of my free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing on the computer.

But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in the way I communicate. It made it possible to discover, to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent. I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone. But we should not forget that they are only tools and should emphasise human relationships.	But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in  way  to communicate.

Dear Sir or Madam	Dear Sir and Madam
I have recently spent a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain about a couple of things.	I am recently spending a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain with  couple of things.
First, I would like to complain about the main , which is an actor. He might be well known in England, but on the night, he performed abysmally. Secondly, a lot of people were not very impressed with the delay, because all of us  had to wait for almost an hour before the show started.

Secondly a lot of people were not very impressed with the time, because all of us  have to wait for almost an hour until the show start.
Also, a lot of people were  about the facilities, which were said to be  in the advertisement. For example, the discount for the tickets was not available, and in particular a lot of people were disappointed that they couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed, due to the cleaner forgetting to clean up the mess from the previous party.

Lastly, I do not think I would call this  my perfect evening, so I would like to ask for a refund, and I hope as the Manager of London's newest theatre, you will handle the situation .

Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I have always got on very well. We always go to the same school, and he often makes more friends than I do, and every time he  introduces me to them. Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone, even himself.

Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secreats for anyone, even himself.
Although, we are great friends,  sometimes people can make such  stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight. It all started when once I accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. I was so nervous and embarrassed, so I told Pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.

I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening  at your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was a totally different actor. As it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because according to the programme it started at 20.15, but that is not the end of the story; in your advertisement it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets. That was not true! I was still not very disappointed, because I hoped that I would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant, which I could have according to your advertisement, but what I did not realise, it was closed, because the chef was in  hospital.

Every day we keep in touch via technology.

Everyday we keep in touch with technology. We have microwaves that help us to do our meal quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that made our life easier.
I use different technological things every day. Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if I am not at home; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music; I use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc. I think that all these things have made my life much easier. Many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot. I am very happy that with all the technology that we have we don't have to work as much as they did, doing things like washing plates and cups after meals. My dishwasher will do that for me, and I don't have to wash my clothes, my washing machine does it better. Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over from humans and of course it makes me lazy. However, now I have more freedom, free time, and privacy.

Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I didn't have a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was another actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to that, the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed by all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was £20 and there weren't any discounts! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I didn't have  great fun, so I ask for that money back. Yours faithfully	Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I hadn't a good time!

There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything. I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to  childhood and the teenage years. We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms. That is only human.	There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything.

The advertisement promised there would be my favourite star, Danny Brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook. In addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already. Moreover, when I was buying our tickets, there weren't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and I are both on a pension. As a result, our evening was completely spoiled. So I am sure you will understand why I am so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incident.

"Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the arrangements for the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was spending some days in London and liked the idea of seeing this show a lot.

The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple. It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish. He is only looking for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccessful for 86 days. This day he is lucky. He gets a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally caught.

First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage during the play.

Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an aggressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible.

We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an agressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from the promise written in the advertisement.
Definitely, I want my money back as soon as possible.	Defineteley, I want my money back as soon as possible.
"""Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets."" I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told her everything about Lynne Harter, our new classmate at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, that was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely aggressive. But I couldn't shut my mouth. I continued: ""You can't believe it, Pat, she wears trousers like a man and green flowery blouses."" Of course, my friend and I were laughing for half an hour. Two days later, when Pat came back to my school,  she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told him everything about Ann1. At precisely that moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault. But, well, the unhappiness started with Pat and my revealed secrets."

I'm writing to you to complain about last evening's musical show. I was very happy to see your musical show but I have to say that it has been a very disappointing evening. At first my favourite actor Danny Brook didn't perform, without any explanations being given, and the show should have started at 19:30 instead of 20:15!! I was sure that discounts were available because I had read that they were, but at the ticket office they didn't offer them. What a terrible evening! So I paid for the ticket. After the show I was hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed!	I'm writing to you to complain about last evening musical show.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told his mother how his brother Jim lost her suit suitcase on the train. Jim's mum didn't want him to take her suitcase, but he did . So one morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and took the train for the countryside where he had to work. But when he walked out of the station he realised that he had left the suitcase on the train. Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it. He was worried about his mother's reaction, but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager's office and he found it on the table. He was so happy! All this story was a secret but Pat revealed it to his mother. She was so angry and confused because Jim hadn't told her the truth.

"I am writing to you because I am really disappointed about ""Over the Rainbow"" which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized. I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all. In your advertisement it said the show would start at 19:30 but it began at 20:15. I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time. Even so, I can't understand why the actors of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't appear in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook. After all this, I wanted to make my evening pleasant but to my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because of some sanitary problems.

There could be many things to say about this. Technology is a wide field which expands very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I can say whether technology has changed our life in a positive way or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we can make a phone call with an astonishing rapidity, whereas in my grandparents' time it took one month or more to get in contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When the first car appeared, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else they want! What can I say about  television? It allows us to maintain connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which have happened or will happen. In, the not very distant, 1914, parents sent their sons to war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible!	There would be many things to say about .

Dear Mr. manager of The Circle Theatre:	Dear Mr. maneger of The Circle Theatre:
I'm writing to you to describe some problems with your theatre's show. First I have to say to you that there was a different actor to the one advertised starring in the play. I expected the star of the play to be Danny Brook and there was another man. I'm very disappointed with the time that the play started. I had been waiting for more than half an hour.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I was fourteen years old and I was with my best friend, Pat. We were in a private school, which looked like a castle, in London and we had been staying there for two months. Our parents took us there because they wanted  us to become good  polite girls. Life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to have fun  there. One day I discovered a secret path in the school. This path went from our bedroom to the director's room. I thought it was a good idea to tell  Pat because we could use it to look for exams, and then we could pass all of them. When I told  her, she promised  me that she would keep the secret. But in a few days she told the secret to all the class. All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic  secret path to look for exams. Then somebody told  a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents. They were very angry and disappointed with us. Nowadays, I remember this story as a bad experience.

First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion of your company, which is said to be the best producer of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended your theatre on the referred day with the aim of having a perfect evening.

Nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents, or even our parents, were living in. Actually, whereas they used to talk about how their daily lives had changed in comparison with previous generations', we remain astonished, looking at how our lives are changing frenetically. We have hardly assimilated one piece of new technology when it is replaced or modified by another.

Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily lives more comfortable and easier, but does that mean that we live better than ever?

The problem is that most  of the advertisement was misleading. First of all, there were no discounts on the tickets' prices, and they were advertised. Secondly, the play was advertised as starting at 19.30, but it started at 20:15. Despite this fact, which I did not care about  at first, when the play started I did not see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor; I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook.

Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, which was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested in seeing the actors that appeared on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw other actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw on the tickets that there would be discounts given, but, they didn't give us discounts! With all these problems, the only thing that kept us going was the thought of eating something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because the staff didn't go to work that day.	Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays.

It was Saturday night, and I was with my sister Pat alone in my home. That night I was invited to a great party, but I was being punished, and I had to stay at home with my sister.

When I entered my room she was very happy, because my father would punish me again. Of course, she would tell him, but I decided to pay her if she stayed quiet.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. When you told her something important, she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it. Actually, even though she was seventeen, she still behaved like a ten-year-old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret, for example. Thus when Sally explained to her that she had fallen in love with Kevin, Pat felt very awkward. In fact, she knew that even if Sally was her best friend, she would not be able to keep such a secret. It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not, she would have preferred not to know it. Pat was totally upset. She felt all the more ill at ease as Sally trusted her. Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, went home, and locked herself in her bedroom. But when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends, she started to cry since she knew that she would use it.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends. We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were going down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp, deep look, never have I seen such a deep look, and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school  from the computer, in other words, hacking into the school software.

"Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to ""the Circle Theatre"" looking forward to watching your musical ""Over the rainbow"". In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but forty-five minutes late. This made me a little bit angry because I already had trouble  buying a ticket earlier: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked to see that there was another actor playing his role. This actor was not nearly as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paid so much money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything else that had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced I have the right to some money back from you because none of your promises was  carried out.

But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked  that there was another actor playing . This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to ""rescue"" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything   had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no ""perfect evening"" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced  to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out. Yours faithfully Gabe Grumman (Mrs)"

17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing  to complain about various things which I am very disappointed with. I went to the theatre to see the musical show called 'Over the Rainbow'. There I met with many problems. First of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available. Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the time of the performance was  9:30. However, the show started at 20:15. I was fed up with waiting. The worst thing of all was that at the beginning of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised. They were worse than the previous actors. After the show, my friends and I were very furious because of all this. We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax. The surprise was that the restaurant was closed. I am really annoyed. In my opinion, you have to give us back us money because everything that you wrote in your advertisement was not true. I hope to get your answer soon. Finally, I want to tell you this is the last time that I come to your theatre. Thank you. Yours sincerely CAROLINA RODRIGEZ.	17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for complaining about different points which I am very disappointing .

Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed. I asked him why the restaurant was closed. He said it was because the manager of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day. They had been closed for 3 days according to him.

As I was spending a weekend in London. I took the opportunity to see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I got to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking of having it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main reason for Mr White's resignation and suicide. Pat was not a very clever teenager and while she was attending  Secondary School she had many problems with Chemistry. I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would never have passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 years old but still good-looking and all my female school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girl felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her classmates and she ran away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any hesitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged with abuse and obliged to resign. The trial was long and received  wide coverage from the media. We live in a small and old-fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: losing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died, terrified by the darkness which was nearing.

First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very excited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theatre the problems began. I was looking forward to getting a discount of several pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet promises, however, it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I am concerned, the show must begin on time, but it started forty-five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seen before, and the restaurant was closed with no notice.

This show was very disappointing for me for many reasons. First of all, I was very surprised by the absence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons for booking a seat. Also, I'm unhappy about the inaccurate information in your advertisement, which clearly says the play begins at 19.30, instead of 20.15 like my evening's show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the other spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons being given and nobody came to us to apologise or advise us about another restaurant open late at  night.

BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED. IN ADDITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET.

First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced by a disappointing actor. Besides that the spectacle was meant to start at 19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts on the tickets were not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe  it, everything that was in the advertisement was a lie.

"Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing that has ever happened in their lives.

Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to scientific developments, I am getting better, recovering from asthma.

I had a very disappointing evening last Saturday. I had everything planned; my family and I were coming to watch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disastrous. Firstly there was no discount available, though you promised one in your advertisement, so even my 6-year-old son was charged the adult price. Then everything was going well until the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30. Well it didn't. It started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And by the way may I ask you how up-to-date your leaflets are because in spite of the advert saying the starring actor was Danny Brook,  it wasn't. It was another actor and one I had never heard of. That was a disappointment for my whole family. In fact all the audience were very disappointed.	I had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday. I had everythig planned, I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous. Firstly there was no available discount, as you said  on your advertisement so even my 6 year old son was charged  adult price. Then everything was going well untill the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it didn't, it started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15.

That was a dissapointment for my whole family,  all the viewers where very dissappointed.
Anyway the show was nowhere near as good as it was meant to be and it was definitely worse than I had expected it to be. I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes, desperately searching for your restaurant, our stomachs rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what would you know?, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no hesitation whatsoever. They even gave us a table number.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact he was one of the principal busybodies of his neighbourhood and his school so not a lot of people in his school liked him. This was . Another bad thing about this school was that there were different types of students that formed groups. Some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. They gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them. This went on and on, got more and more serious, but it was so secret that the teachers didn't notice.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very firmly to keep it a secret, especially from the other groups. But Pat was so excited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates. And the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party. But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party. Everyone in the year was annoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party. No one could do anything about it, except a few psycho groups. Some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meanness of it.

The time had come. The  groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike. They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready.

The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing stones back and shooting everyone with BB guns.

First of all, the advertisement for the shows provided absolutely FALSE information about the cast. Danny BROOK, who should have appeared according to your advertisement, was replaced by  another actor and that disappointed me. The show should start at 19.30. However, the audience waited for forty-five minutes. Also, in the advertisement you mentioned discounts which were not provided. The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I did not receive an explanation why. On the whole, the evening was boring and disappointing.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Her school classmates were going to throw their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise for her. They organized everything. The event was going to take place in the garden at Paula's house. Some of them were in charge of bringing music. The others had to bring food. That  afternoon they arrived at Paula's house  to decorate the place. Balloons and coloured lights were put in all the trees. A table was laid with a lot of delicious food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it. Some time later everything was finally prepared. The garden was wonderful. The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise. But things didn't happen as they had planned. Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this.	Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Dear  Manager of the Circle Theatre,	Dear The Manager of the Circle Theatre,
First of all, the actor was different from the one mentioned in your advertisement. I mean he was not Danny Brook. Secondly,  about forty-five minutes, because it started at 20:15. . Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount on your ticket price with my ID card. Besides this, the theatre restaurant closed early. As soon as the show ended, I went  there  to have a dessert.	First of all, the actor was different from  your advertisement. I meant he was not Danny Brook.

Clothes are part of each culture and one of those things which express our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out.

People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear ordinary clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to avoid  boredom. I am sure that eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free. There won't be any problem with being up-do-date.

Recently, we had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, and the Internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to  before. My father is a sailor and I see him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phones I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping on the Internet. This way I don't have to  be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients.

However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing on the computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should ban cars from city centres, and close down factories which produce too much waste. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may also be harmful.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a 25-year-old secretary in a big company. Her boss was a rich man, really rich. His name was Timson White.

People have been wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything has changed: style, colour, quality. Fashion.

I will tell  you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the next 100 years.

We cannot deny that technology has changed our lives. Nowadays, we no longer need to spend hours cooking, for example: we just put some frozen food in the microwave, and in a few minutes our meal is ready.

Another thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone, because people can talk to me whenever they need to, but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when I am in an important meeting.

"I bought a ticket for the ""Over the Rainbow"" musical show last Saturday, but I felt very disappointed with it. It was announced that there would be discount tickets available, but there were not. The show should have started at 19.30, but it was delayed forty-five minutes. And,  worst of all: Danny Brook was not on stage. He was replaced by a novice actor who gave a very disappointing performance. Last, the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a pipe and the kitchen was flooded."

The Internet is certainly the most obvious of all these innovations.

For a shy person, like me, the Internet has another attraction: the opportunity of knowing people and making friends worldwide. It's very exciting.

I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to get a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had sold out. I could not understand why but I still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry after waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so badly that I left the theatre before it finished.

A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did not. However, they are equally important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so ashamed that I lowered my head.

Nowadays, mordern technology has increasingly been developing. We get many advantages which make improve our lives daily, on the other hands, we get also many disadvantages which could harm us.
In my opinion, the main advantage is the development of medical technology. For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting your leg off, the new medical technology could rebuild part of your body. Another advantage is sharing information. The more developed the technology is, the quicker and easier international networking is. So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different countries.

When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity I ever had to attend  a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writing to you.

As I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publicised on their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors  starring in the musical were one of its major attractions. Another point that I want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was  major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered  your food  unhealthy, and I am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but then I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the 19:30 performance but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the  show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent on the musical. I look forward to hearing from you.

Some days ago Pat met her friend Paul, the editor of the school's newspaper. Paul asked her some questions about her childhood and her toys because he was going to write an article about children.

Pat told him some unimportant things such as she learnt to swim at the age of five or that she loved ants. But, suddenly, she started to talk about Marion's toys.

"My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old. I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical. I expected more from it. First of all the actor was the same as last semester. I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well in this musical. Then I was sat with my friend just waiting for the start and that lasted forever and it was supposed to start at 19:30. After the show I felt really hungry, so I intended to go to the restaurant, which  was closed. By this time I thought: ""I want my money back.""

"Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisement regarding the musical show ""Over the rainbow"" I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above-mentioned show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your advertisement the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apology. We had been told that discounts on the ticket prices were available but on the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant, which was - to our surprise - closed because of the  delay!

"I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II was always in search of answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure""."

There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appeared not long ago. Among them, the mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different appliances for the kitchen, machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they greatly simplify the life of people. For example, now women don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing  dishes. They can just turn on their dishwashers and go to do something that they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new modern technology people have got much more free time. The computer also plays a very important role in the daily life of people. Some years ago people, especially students, had to run to libraries in order to find a book about something. But now they can use the Internet, where you can find any information you need. I use the Internet very often, and I must say it is very convenient. Another piece of modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone.

Firstly, I decided to go see your show to be entertained by the performance of Danny Brook so I was very sad to find another actor on the stage. Another thing was the time. In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. It's unbelievable it was 45 minutes late.

When I got to the ticket office before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available such as I had read on the advertisement.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she got me in  trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed  with a host family in a suburb of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met were very interesting so everything was perfect. We mostly had a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I was only 19 years old and as everyone knows  the age of majority, when you are able to go out in the USA, is 21 years old. If you  have not reached your majority you aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or, even worse, to go into a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and I decided to go  to a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in . At the entrance, the security guard asked for my identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that I'd left it at home. The man said it was OK  this time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it. It was such  fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to get thirsty. We went to the bar and asked for an alcoholic drink. Of course by the time we got  it we had forgotten all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking  19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening ended with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping a secret so well!!

"During my last holiday  in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement for the ""Over the rainbow"" show. I wanted to spend my free time well by taking in that cultural event. How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed. First of all, in the advertisement it was written, as I had read  before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, a different actor stood in for  him.  was written as half past two p.m. and  half past seven that evening, again. Lack of  time made me go to the evening show. And unfortunately again, for some reason, it was delayed until quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement it was definitely written that there were some  discounts on the tickets. No, alas, in reality it appeared to be a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough still. At the end of the advertisement  I noticed it said something about a perfect evening out. It wasn't true. That's why I am writing my letter to you and I am asking for my money back. I was expecting something much better. Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet in  court."

I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affect every aspect of my daily life. Looking back to the past, I can see how big a difference there is between the life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so much as we can now and couldn't  the news around the world as we do  now, in the present day. They could not communicate with someone living in another country,  located far away from their own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or the Internet, we have  better access to a lot of different information.

So, we are in a better situation now. But there are some drawbacks, which appeared in recent years. For example, a lot of pollution has been created. We now breathe worse air in our lungs than our grandparents breathed. I think we are more addicted to doing some things which are not concerned with human nature. For example, people are addicted today to watching TV or often using  mobile phones. I don't really mind them. But I think and strongly believe that we are a part of nature. And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us, but  might destroy us.	So, we are in  better situation now.

Firstly, the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price of £20 because discounts were not available although in your advertisement they were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the great Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and another unknown person was singing. And last but not least, I found out after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come...	Firsty the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later.

I don't know whether it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed.

In my opinion, modern technology has changed our daily life tremendously.	In my opinion modern technology changed our daily life tremendously.
First of all it changed our lifestyle. For example, ten years ago  almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TVs. Because  people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively - they can often visit their friends and travel much more. People today are more  for the world.	First of all it changed our life-style.

Secondly, we can do our jobs today more efficiently. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our clients faster and better and offer them better services. Ordered goods can be delivered in a shorter time by trains, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more in our daily life - on better clothes, furniture, .	Secondely we can do our jobs today more efficient.

The problem is that there were some differences between the advertisement and the show I saw. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed like a rookie.

Moreover, there weren't any discounts available (I'm a student but I paid for a full-price ticket).	The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen.

How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance  to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by  others which are more helpful and useful.

I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but, with my surprise, the show started at 20:15 and so I couldn't remain here until the end because I  left London, with my group before the end of the show. The star, the actor Danny Brook, there wasn't in the musical show but there was an other actor, with my great disappoint.

I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and interesting.

First of all I recommend you go on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all your questions.

I think you should take a packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle).

"TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to it for endless hours every day, unable to press the ""Off"" button on the remote control.

I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the other hand when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived in a complete TV vacuum for three weeks. I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings.	I can honestly say: I could.
